The revenues of the districts assigned to the vassals of the crown or to the sub-vassals of the great feudatories, such as Tancred of Tiberias, were easily collected from the heads of the villages or casalia which covered the country with a perfect Whenever the Latins established themselves in such net-work. centres as Jaffa or Jerusalem or Tiberias the population of the surrounding country submitted to them as a matter of course. The friendly relations of the native Christians and Moslems, established by long association, remained undisturbed, with the difference that the Christians for a time were the principal medium in the development of friendly intercourse with the new rulers. Zahir ed-din Tugtakin of Damascus (1098-1128) might have made the Latin occupation of northern Palestine But his outlook and activity were more in the insecure. direction of Tripolis, and for several years he seems to have refrained as far as possible from active hostilities. His only collision was with Tancred of Tiberias when that chief claimed the revenues of some districts beyond Jordan which were tributary to Damascus.  The real task which the Latins had to face was the conquest Until these were subdued even the of the towns on the coast. occupation of the interior was precarious and the lines of communication with Europe unsafe. In southern Syria they were the only wealthy and important towns excepting Jerusalem and Damascus. But their strength from a military point of view was much weakened by their political isolation. Each town depended for its defence almost entirely upon its own inhabitants, and the military element, especially in the larger towns, was no doubt small compared with the civilian population.

On the other hand their capture was easily effected when the command of the sea was held by an Italian fleet. The Egyptian fleets hardly ever fought a naval battle and altogether played a very timorous part in the struggle. On the other hand the Italian states sent fleets to Palestine which eagerly off^ered their services to the Latin princes. They had played a part in the first crusade during the operations against Antioch, 'Arka and Jerusalem. After the fall of Jerusalem they came again, conveying bands of pilgrims from Europe. At once they saw their opportunity. When the Syrian coast towns were conquered they could establish markets there and import their merchandise free of duty. To these Italians the new colonies were the doors of commercial intercourse between east and west. The Italian fleets were the decisive factor in the conquest of Latin Syria. The republics which equipped them and sent them forth were rewarded by the grant of a special quarter in such towns as they assisted in capturing. A large and wealthy Italian population soon controlled a great part of the revenues of the coast towns and the surrounding districts and enjoyed a system of communal government, much to the advantage of their trade and commerce. The one disadvantage of their presence was that they introduced another line of cleavage into an already much divided state. But the evil consequences of this are scarcely apparent for a century or more and at the outset the co-operation of the Italians was an essential condition of the success of the Latin  enterprise.

On the voyage home, after a visit paid to Tyre and Sidon, they also met with disaster, for 25 of the ships were wrecked in a storm.  Tugtakin's share in the invasion of this year is noteworthy. It seems to have been the course of domestic affairs which at length involved him in war with the Latins. In June 1104 Dukak of Damascus died.

Both a cause and a symptom of the change is the establishment of a new relation between Tripolis and Jerusalem. Before relating the events of 1 109 it is desirable to sketch the history of Tripolis up to this point.  The early history of Latin Tripolis gives it a certain claim to separate mention in the list of Latin states. But previous to 1 109 it was merely a state in embryo. Tripolis, its capital,- was still in Moslem hands and the Latin towns were few and com- paratively insignificant. The conquest of the district was at last effected by the help of Baldwin of Jerusalem and others of the As a consequence Tripolis became a neighbouring Latins. dependency of Jerusalem.

Tugtakin aimed persistently at the conquest of Homs and Hama, and these towns were the near neighbours of Tripolis. The valley of the Bika', between the ranges of Lebanon and Anti-lebanon, may be said to have lain within the territory of Damascus, and after the death of Jenah ed-daula of Homs, in May 1 103, Homs itself was a dependency. When Baldwin was on his way south to become Godfrey's successor (October i icx)) the Moslem forces which obstructed his passage through the pass north of the Dog River (Nahr el-kelb) were chiefly from Homs and Damascus ^ Tugtakin also gave some help to the Moslems of Tripolis, during their nine years struggle with the Latins. At the same time the hills of Lebanon and the Jebel Ansariya form a natural boundary to the west of which the Latins might establish themselves without causing much concern to the rulers of Damascus. Damascus always faced towards Aleppo, and whatever question might complicate the problems of Syrian politics its first concern was to strengthen its position and to expand its territories in that direction. When Homs and Hama were tributary it still looked northwards and not to the coast of Tripolis. The Latins deprived Damascus of no territory which it coveted or possessed so long as they remained within the shelter of the hills which divided them from the central plains of Syria. Raymond might in fact establish himself in Tripolis without encountering much opposition from Tugtakin. The measure of his success would be the measure of his superiority over the local emirs. With \"marvellous audacity\" he sought to conquer Tripolis with a force of some 4CX> men^ His chief gains were made with the help of two Italian fleets. Aided by them and by western pilgrims he secured a footing in the county from which he could not easily be dislodged.

In February 1 105, when Raymond died, the princedom which had so often escaped him seemed at length to be just within his grasp.  When Raymond began operations in 1102 he was assisted by the crusaders who had survived the disasters of the previous year in Asia Minor and by a Genoese fleet which came north- wards after having paid a short visit to Jerusalem. Antartus yielded to the Latin forces, with little or no resistance, and was left \"by common consent\" in Raymond's hands (March 1102)^ He had a claim to this town dating from the time of the first Fakhr el-mulk, emir of Tripolis, seeing the Latins crusaded within easy reach of his very gates, now sent for help to Homs and Damascus.

The surviving leaders of the crusade were all assembled in Antioch about the beginning of March (\" Martio inchoante,\" Albert viii. 41), and they reached Jaffa, after the capture of Antartus, a fortnight before Easter, which fell on the 6th of April (Albert viii. 44, cf. Fulcher ii. 17). This makes the capture of Antartus about the middle of March. The date of the Chron. Maxentii 241 is accordingly a month too late (xii Kal. Mali = 20th April). Hagen- meyer, Chronologic x. 403 ff. , accepts Bamberger's correction of the Chron. Maxentii into xii Kal. Martii (i8th February) and argues against the reading Martio inchoante in Albert viii. 41. The date of Baldwin's arrival at Beirut about the beginning of March (p. 45, n. 5) does not, however, seem to affect Albert's date for the re-union of the crusaders in Antioch, since the king's protection for the pilgrims may have been requested even before the leaders had all assembled, and Baldwin did not require many days to prepare for his movement to Beirut.  ^ Immediately before the attack on Antartus Raymond was a prisoner of Tancred's in Antioch for a short time and was released on the condition \"ne quidquam terrae hac ex parte civitatis Acrae [ = 'Akka] invaderet \" (Albert viii. 42). It has been assumed by modern historians that his occupation of Antartus was a breach of his If so it is remarkable that Albert, so far from suggesting this, promise to Tancred. almost excludes it by the way in which he relates the matter. When Fulcher ii. 16 says that the pilgrims expected Raymond to accompany them to Jerusalem he is not necessarily in conflict with Albert's statement that the city was given to Raymond ex communi consilio.  Fulcher says nothing about Raymond's oath to Tancred.  ^ Sibt iii. 525 gives Jumada ii 495 (commences 23rd March 1102) as the date of the battle, and he and Anna 67 f. and Caffarus, Liberatio xviii. 47, the locality as just I. A. i. 211 f. narrates the same events as happening previous to outside Antartus. the siege of Antartus and locates the battle outside Tripolis (to which the Moslems retreated according to Caffarus).

It began with a casual attack on Laodicea by Kantakouzenos. He had just been pursuing a Genoese fleet without success and probably learned that the opportunity was favourable for an attack on Laodicea^ The harbour was captured at the first assault and the town was occupied apparently without resistance. The citadel continued in possession of its garrison, a force of 600 men. When the emperor learned what the position of affairs was he sent an army overland to co-operate with the fleet. As it marched through Cilicia on its way the Latin garrisons were expelled by the inhabitants of the Cilician towns and the Greeks were received with open arms^. Before it reached Laodicea Kanta- kouzenos had gained several seaports in the direction of Tripolis. The date of the capture of the citadel is unknown. out when Bohemond returned from Edessa, for he provisioned it afresh and changed its garrison. Probably its capture influenced his decision to leave Antioch at the end of summer. He recognised that his forces were unequal to the conflict which the fatal enmity of Greece imposed. He summoned Tancred to Antioch and informed him that he had decided to leave the princedom in his hands while he himself sailed to Europe to raise fresh forces. He left Syria at the close of summer\", never In France and elsewhere his appeals for help met to return. Having gathered a large army with an enthusiastic response. he resolved to attack his arch enemy Alexius in Europe. In the latter part of 1107 he laid siege to Durazzo.

During the early part of the reign of Baldwin II the situation in Jerusalem was similar to what it had been in the latter part of the reign of his predecessor. The attacks from Egypt ceased altogether and those of Damascus were purely incidental and insignificant (1119-1121)1 The assassination of El-afdal (5th December 1121)2 made no immediate difference in the policy of the former country. The Latins, having secured their position, did not meantime seek to extend their borders. The Moslems, having ascertained their opponents' strength, were disposed to acquiesce in the Latin occupation. Nevertheless neither the Syrian Latins nor the western pilgrims enjoyed in Palestine in these years the security of a settled country. The real situation is disclosed by the early history of the \" poor knights of Christ,\" afterwards called the knights Templars, from their place of residence in the temple area at Jerusalem. The roads from the coast to the holy places were infested by Arabs whose de- predations were made easier by the Moslem inhabitants of the In these circumstances, in 11 19, Hugh de Payns and country. seven other knights vowed to devote their lives to the protection of pilgrims and travellers in the holy land. They conformed to the practice of the regular orders by professing poverty, chastity and obedience. When the council of Troyes formally sanctioned the order and gave it a rule (11 28) the knights still numbered only nine, and no great change had taken place in the character and service of the order.  From the summer of 11 22 until April 1x25 Baldwin was continuously absent from his kingdom and for a considerable part of that time he was a prisoner. After his capture (April  ^ Fulcher iii. 40.

In the beginning of July 1121 Tugtakin ravaged the Latin territories east of the Jordan. When Baldwin crossed into the Hauran against him (5th July) he retreated and there was no regular battle.

The Latin captives were released for a ransom ^ and it was agreed that the revenues of Jebel summak and the other territories in dispute should be divided.

The account of William of Tyre is generally accepted\\ This historian says that during the siege, the duration of which he does not state, some of the Syrian knights were bribed by Anar and treacherously advised that the allied camp should be moved from the orchards to the open country south and east of the city. They are supposed to have done so because they knew that the second position was untenable owing to the difficulty of obtaining water The leaders discovered this after the change and provisions. had been made and resolved to retreat when they found that the orchards had been occupied by the enemy.  It is to be remembered that the new position spoken of lay just outside the woods in which the crusaders were and we are asked to suppose that the leaders were in utter ignorance of the character of the ground there and took no precaution to ascertain whether the (alleged) statements made to them were true or false. The Arabic historians have no account of the movement and Abu Ya'la's narrative leaves room for it only on the night before the retreat was commenced. If assigned to that night it becomes almost incredible, for we have then to suppose (as has been done) that \" a single glance revealed the situation 2\" and yet that the leaders had supposed they were is much more likely that moving to a better position.

Perhaps the troops of Damascus had harassed the Latins from Banyas and Damascus although Saladin was absent in the north. In any case the Latins had reason to be apprehensive because of the weakness of their northern border. It would have been a bolder policy to attempt the recovery of Banyas. But the site of the new castle was well chosen for its purpose. It was built just beside a ford on the Jordan known as Jacob's ford. It guarded the sea road from Damascus, the via maris, along which the Moslem invaders swept westward to harry the lowlands of Galilee.

Makrizi viii. 531 explains that he took part of Saladin's army to Egypt because there was a scarcity of food supplies in Syria (26th Dhu'l-ka'da 574, 5th May 11 79). According to LA. i. 640 he resigned Ba'albek and received Alexandria in Dhu'l-ka'da 575 (which commences 29th March 1180) and Ferukh shah then received Ba'albek.

Although it suited Saladin's plans to have peace with his opponents, the first overtures seem to have been made by the Latins.

The causes of Baldwin struggled bravely the discord have been already stated. to discharge his duties and accompany his troops in the field.

The confused narrative of Benedict i. 345 and 359 is inconsistent with his representation and yet supplies a certain amount of conRnnation of it. Benedict makes the truce consist of two terms, the second an extension of the first. The first was to last until \"next Easter,\" i.e. Easter of 1186 (seeing the year in question is 1 185) ; the second for three years longer. This agrees with Emoul in making the truce commence in 1185 and last in all for nearly four years. It is however impossible that Guy should have renewed the truce, for he was not king in April 1186, and the date of the arrangement of the truce is given in the wrong year 1185 (6-9 months too late). The second error is a consequence of the mistake of dating the Moslem invasion of 1184 in 1185 (see p. 135, n. 4).  ' It is obvious from Saladin's movements that the peace must have been concluded at the end of 11 84 or the very commencement of 1185 (note 4). Ernoul apparently puts it later than the death of Baldwin IV, but that must itself be determined in part by the date of the treaty. For the practice of dating the duration of a truce from Easter and including the intervening months as additional to the years of the treaty compare Richard's treaty with Saladin in 1191 (Chap. V, p. 186).  * DhuM-ka'da 580, ending 4th March 1185, Kern. Blochet 85 = iv. 173.

Barheb. 424 also agrees with (i), (2) and (4) which may be accepted as giving the figures correctly, although a letter of Richard's in Hoveden iii. 131 speaks of 1500 captives only. In addition to the sum of 200,000 dinars, 10,000 were promised to Conrad and 4,000 to some of the official members of his household ('Imad ed-din 358 and Beh. in A.S. Cairo ii. 188, line i r f.).

It was Saladin's proposal (Beh.) *Imad ed-din, who does not, however, and therefore not part of the first agreement. mention any alteration in the terms, explicitly states that the emirs had agreed that half the money, all the prisoners and the holy cross should be handed over \" at the end of the month \" and that the other half of the money should be paid at the end of the following month (Landberg 358 f.). This agrees with I.A.'s statement that two months were allowed for the discharge of the Moslem obligations (Kamil ii. 46). Against 'Imad ed-din and LA. is to be set Benedict ii. 179, which makes the time fixed in the original agreement for the complete dischat^e of all obligations 40 days. This period however may have been got merely by calculation of the interval between It may be July nth and August 20th (unless, indeed, for XL we should read L.\\). assumed that the date of the release of the Moslem captives was fixed both in the emirs' agreement and in Saladin's. 'Imad ed-din 371 possibly implies that all were to be released at the end of the first month in the original agreement. I.A.'s accusation against Richard, that he would only release part of the prisoners at the end of the first term (p. 272, n. i), presumably implies that he was pledged to release them all then. It may be observed that the expression primus dies peremptorius in Benedict ii. 187, need not be a recognition of the three term agreement but may denote August 9th in contrast to August 20th (cf. p. 271, n. 2)."

Benedict ii. 187 gives the date as 9th August, i.e. possibly a month of 28 days after the capture. The evidence of Ambrose is indefinite and indirect. He dates the execution of the captives about the middle of August (line 5570) and makes this two or three weeks after the expiry of the fixed term (lines 5373-4, 5490). He may therefore have dated the expiry of the term at the end of July.  2 Beh. iii. 242 and 'Imad ed-din 371.  It appears likely that on the nth of August the prisoners of distinction chosen by the Latins for release had not all been brought to the Moslem camp near 'Akka (Beh.). But the fact is not decisive on the point of Saladin's ability to fulfil his obligations when it became necessary, especially if the date of the first term had already been extended at Richard's request from the Qth (or nth) to the 20th of August (Benedict ii. 187). It is equally true that Richard was not in a position to release all the Moslem prisoners on the nth of August. Some were still in the custody of Conrad of Tyre and it was even doubtful it The question the English king could get possession of them at all (Benedict ii. 187). whether Saladin finally, on the 20th of August, was in a position to fulfil his obliga- tions is not easy to answer definitely because of the conflict of testimony between the eastern and western sources. The probabilities of the case depend largely on the extent of the obligations to be discharged on that day. Saladin's chief difficulty no doubt was the collecting of the prisoners whom the Latins named for release. If the 100 were to be set free all together in the first batch (see p. 270, n. 3) it is conceivable that Saladin did not succeed in gathering them completely or at least that the Latins Assuming might plausibly allege that he had not done all he was bound to do. however that he exerted himself to do his part, as he really did, it is unlikely that more than a very few of those still alive were wanting and one would suppose that 'Imad ed-din 371 definitely asserts that the even they would in the end be traced. prisoners were all assembled and presumably Saladin negotiated on the basis of this The statement of Benedict ii. 189 that on the i6th of August assumption (cf. Beh.). Saladin acknowledged that he could not fulfil his part of the compact certainly demands qualification and may be as unfounded as the following statement that Saladin executed his captives on the i8th. The allegation that Saladin asked for an extension of time on the 15th (Benedict ii. 188) is not indeed incredible, but may simply be the western way of putting Saladin's proposal as reported by Beh. and â€¢Imad ed-din. Ambrose speaks in general terms of the Moslems demanding \" terms and respites that they might seek the Cross\" (lines 5398-99) and represents Saladin's conduct as a consequence of his bad faith and unwillingness to fulfil his engagements. This representation is sufficiently accounted for by the extensions granted at Sala- din's instance (p. 270, n. 3) and at that of Richard himself (Benedict ii. 187) and by Saladin's ultimate failure to fulfil the treaty of the emirs (p. 272, n. i).

Besides the evidence of the translator is weakened by his misapprehension of the date when the term expired Ernoul 276 says that Saladin twice asked for an extension of time and (p. 271, n. i). was twice granted it. No doubt it was currently reported in the Latin camp that the sultan either could not fulfil his obligations or was unwilling to do so.  ^ According to LA. Kamil ii. 47, Richard demanded that Saladin should discharge his obligations (i.e. those of the first term) and trust to receiving in exchange a part of the Moslem captives selected by the Latins themselves. Beh. agrees that Richard expected Saladin to surrender the instalment of the first term without any guarantee that the Latins would give anything in return. There can be little doubt that Richard's answer was due at first to his being unable to guarantee the release of the Moslem prisoners (cf. Benedict ii. 187, and p. 271, n. 7). But after the 12th of August all the prisoners had come into his hands (Benedict) and this difficulty was removed. May it then be supposed that having once given his answer he adhered to it from motives of personal feeling rather than of public policy? The first-rate evidence of the Arabic sources (Beh., *Imad ed-din and LA.) seems to establish beyond dispute that the negotiations were broken off because Saladin was dissatisfied with the manner in which the Latins proposed to perform their obligations, and was in fact suspicious of their good faith. The explanation of the western sources, that Saladin was unable to fulfil the terms of the treaty within the time fixed, apart from the question of fact, which is more than doubtful (p. 271, n. 2), is in itself less plausible. The extension of the first term beyond the 9th or the nth of August was in any case not caused by 187), and it is very Saladin's inability to discharge his obligations (Benedict ii. improbable that mere unreadiness on Saladin's part would have put an end to the negotiations. The 16th of August is the latest date for which an exchange of In Richard's own letter.(Hoveden iii. 131) messages is recorded (Benedict ii. 188 f.). the only comment on the breaking off of the negotiations is contained in the words â€¢â€¢termino exspirato et pactione quam pepigerat [SaladinusJ penitus infirmata.\"  '^ Beh. iii. 242 ; cf. p. 273, n. 1.

After Leo's death, however, in 12 19, he failed to make himself king in Cilicia and so lost Antioch also. Bohemond now ruled Antioch and Tripolis for fifteen years longer (1219-34), at peace with the Moslems for the most part, but still carrying on a bitter feud with the knights of the Hospital. The practical independence of the Hospitallers and their territorial claims, especially in Tripolis, multiplied occasions of conflict and disputed If there was no longer civil war, there was almost no co-operation against the neighbouring Moslem states. The earlier civil war in Antioch and the later divisions  ^ In A.H. 599 (ends 9th September 1203) Antioch was threatened by Leo (Makrizi ix. 125 ; cf. Gestes 16, Leo occupies Antioch for four days in 1203) ; in September 1204, Muharram 601, and also later in the year, Leo attacked Antioch and Ez-zahir came to Bohemond's assistance (Kem. Blochet 141 f.) ; in December 1205, Jumada i 602, Leo attacked the neighbourhood of Darbassak which was a dependency of Aleppo (Kem. Blochet 142 f.) ; in the spring of 1206, Shawal 602, there was war between Leo and the Moslems of Aleppo; in the summer an eight years peace was made in which Antioch was included (Kem. Blochet 143 f. ; A.S. v. 154 f. gives some particulars of the same war) ; according to Kem. Blochet 145 Leo was compelled by the sultan of Rum in alliance with Aleppo to surrender Bagras to the Templars and to make peace with Antioch in A.H. 605 (i6th July 1208â€”5th July 1209); perhaps the  eight years peace should be dated from this year.  Regarding Bagras see note 2.  2 Annales ii.  ii. 436; Haithum i. 483; Ibn Wasil quoted by Blochet ix. 157 (Shawal 612, commencing 23rd January 1216). According to Ibn Wasil (ix. 157 and 159 f.) Leo now made peace with Aleppo and surrendered Bagras to the Templars. Eracles ii. 137 specifies the same date for the surrender of Bagras but is not self-con- sistent (see p. 258, n. i),  ^ Annales ii. ii. 439 puts Bohemond's death in 1233.  Leroulx 174, note 2 argues for a date in the beginning of 1234, which Annales would reckon part of 1233. Rupen's grants to the Hospitallers in Antioch were long a subject of contention with Bohemond. An agreement was at length come to in October 1231 (Leroulx, Cartulaire ii. no, 2000). The rival claims of the Templars and the Hospitallers to Jabala were not settled until June 1233 (Leroulx ii. 1739 and 2058). It appears that the Moslems and the Latins in some way shared Jabala all this time."

The emperor's intention to make an expedition to Palestine was well known beforehand to the Moslems. El-kamil actually sent envoys to negotiate with him in Europe. There can be no doubt that he offered concessions in Palestine at the expense of his brother El-mu'azzam, similar probably to those he was previously willing to grant to the crusaders in Egypt. Frederick seems to have thought that the sultan might perhaps restore the whole kingdom of Jerusalem as it had been before Saladin's It is incredible that El-kamil should have entertained victories. such an idea at any time and, besides, the situation in Moslem Syria immediately before and after Frederick's arrival had altered very much to the sultan's advantage. His great rival El-mu'azzam of Damascus died in the latter part of the year 1227 (i2th November) ^ and Palestine was occupied by an Egyptian army in the summer of 1228^ Damascus remained in the hands of El-mu'azzam's son El-malik en-nasir Da'ud, whose claims were at first recognised by his uncle El-malik el-ashraf, sultan of Euphratesia and overlord of northern Syria. About the end of November (1228), however, El-ashraf agreed that El-kamil should retain Palestine on condition that Damascus should be conceded to himself. The assurance of the Moslem sultans that Frederick was not a serious menace to their schemes may be inferred from the fact that El-ashraf now commenced the siege of Damascus and devoted himself to this undertaking  Annales ii. ii. 438 mentions the event under A.D. 1218; also that two towers  107). were built at Jaffa in a.d. 1230.  * Ibn Kh. ii. 439 (8lh hour of Friday 30th DhuM-ka'da 614, calendar date nth November, or the evening of 1st Dhu'l-hijja ; i.e. Thursday night or Friday morning).

The prospects of the Latins were now dark in the extreme. They had no army left and the troops of Ayub and of his Turkish allies ranged over the country without fear of further opposition. Ayub indeed was still on friendly terms with the emperor Frederick and in communication with him. But the emperor was more than ever alienated from the Pope and from those who now controlled the policy of the Syrian Latins. Ayub refused to release his prisoners or to make any compact or even to listen to any intercession except that of the emperor. Thus the only means of reconciliation were such that the Syrian Latins either could not or would not avail themselves of them. Fortunately Ayub had still to deal with his Moslem rivals Isma'il and Da'ud, and this gave the Latins a limited respite.  ^ Chron. Mail. 163.

The commencement of every month is determined by observation, which varies from place to place, and may be at least a day sooner or later than the \"calendar date.\" From the nature of the calendar actual observation should usually give dates that are  earlier than the corresponding calendar dates, but the difficulty  of observation in unfavourable climatic conditions is such that the divergence of actual dates from calendar dates is generally It follows from these circumstances that on the side of lateness. variations of one or two days between the dates of Arabic writers for the same event are usually caused by variations in the assumed date of the commencement of the month in which the event falls. The 13th of Rajab in one writer is the same as the 15th of Rajab in another (p. 261, n. 5). The 5th, 6th and 7th of Rabi* ii may all denote the same day (p. 151, n. 4). The Arabic historians were perfectly aware of this imperfection in their system of dating and in order to prevent uncertainty they regularly name the day of the week along with the day of the month (p. 315, n. i). Where the week day is wanting in Moslem dates, owing to the neglect of copyists or otherwise, there is no certainty regarding the actual day and no presumption in favour of the calendar date. When the actual date is known to be different from the calendar date it is usually a day later and it may be two days. It is more rarely a day before the calendar date and seldom, if ever, two days.

Any estimate of the value of the chronological framework of Amalric's reign must take account of a most damaging fact which appears at the outset. William Tyre's narrative passes in silence over the year 1 166, and the system of dating by regnal years takes no account of the omission, being constructed on the assumption that the relative dating of the narrative correctly indicates the number of years in the king's reign. xix. 12 is the point at which A.D. 11 66 is passed over, and the contents of the chapter heading indicate that William Tyre left this portion of his narrative unfinished with the intention of completing it during revision.

The author of the framework may have had one or two regnal dates given him in William Tyre's narrative (e.g. in xiii. 18) or he may have based his calculations on the information he possessed regarding the king's death year. Given a single equation and two or three Christian year dates he would be in a position to supply all the material that is contained in the above table.  The most obscure part of the relative chronology of this reign is at the end, where it is particularly important because of its bearing on the date of Baldwin's death. In xiii. 25 the death of the patriarch of Jerusalem, which took place in 1128 (Rohricht 184, note 8), is put in the same year as the coming of Fulk to Jerusalem (.spring 1 1 29). Conceivably the representation is due to a source which reckoned the spring of 1 1 29 part of"

An important fact in connection with the dates of the above table is that several of them do not agree with the relative According to it Fulk's chronology of William Tyre's history. If the death year of the death year appears to be 1 144 (p. 147). emperor John was given by William himself as 1 143 (see above), it is impossible that he should have made Fulk's death year 1 142. In Amalric's reign if the death of Thomas a Becket be taken as a fixed point (xx. 23), the death year of the king falls in 11 75 (or 1 174). The relative chronology of Baldwin II's reign favours 1 30 as the year of that king's death unless its author (William Tyre) supposed that Bohemond II died in 11 31. In the case of Baldwin III the relative dating is ambiguous. A year is completely omitted from the history, either just before or just In the former case Baldwin III  after the death of the king. died in February 1163, in the latter in February 1 162.  1  In the reigns of Baldwin II, Baldwin III and Amalric there are other equations of Christian and regnal dates which may be compared with the equations for the death years of these kings. The equation xiiiÂ° = A.D. ii 3 1 agrees with the other equa- tions in the framework of Baldwin II's reign. The equations xxÂ° = A.D. 1162 and xiiÂ° = A.D. 1173 on the other hand are not parallel to the other equations of the reigns of Baldwin III and Amalric, according to which the former should be 11 63 and the It follows from these facts that the author of the latter 1175. framework has constructed his system of death year dates in part independently of the systems he applied to the events of each reign.  The last question connected with these dates is what has been the history of their insertion in William Tyre's narrative.
