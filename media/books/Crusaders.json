Theinvaders came fromWestern Europe andwere the\\nsoldiers ofthefirst \\\"European concert.\\\" Buttheir enterprise itself\\nwasnonovelty. Syria isastagewhich wajts_from century to\\ncentury forarepetition ofthesame drama. Itsdestiny is^tobe\\ninvaded and_tobeconquered. Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian,\\nPersian, Greek, Roman, Arab, Turk, along succession ofaliens\\nhavebeen themakers ofSyrian history. Theland isgeographi-\\ncally distinct, anatural unity, yetthepeople have Jiever_achieyed\\ntheunity ofanational state. Their centr alandexposed position\\ninvites attack,,. Themountains which crowd thelandfrom north\\ntosouth have favoured thegrowth ofpetty city-states and\\nkingdoms. And sotheSyrians have always been apeople\\nready toperish.\\nSyria in1097wasnoteffectively part ofanyempire. Its\\nlatest cormu^ors^iJie^SeJjukJ[jnjcs, wereengaged incivil war.\\nEvery city ruler was prince again forthetime. The cities\\nseldom ornever change, sothat thecity-states of^he_4Der]od\\nare^those alsoofolder times. Damascus, Jerusalem, H^math\\n(Hama), Tyre,Aleppo (Haleb) andAntioch areamong themost\\nimportant. Disunity wastheir fatalweakness, inspite ofmany\\nadvantages which they possessed. The defence offortified\\ntowns against attack waseven easier then than now. The\\ninvaders were farfrom their nearest base ofsupplies, andwere\\nnotthemselves united. They hadtaken theSignoftheCross\\nasasymbol ofthatwhich theyhad incommon, theLatin form\\nofChristianity. Butinternational jealousy and rival am\\\"bitIons\\ns.c.\",\"INTRODUCTION\\nmarred their concert. They hadcombined tomake aconquest,\\nbutwithout anyagreement regarding thefuture division or\\ngovernment ofthecountry. The leaders were infullearnest\\nonlywhere therewasaprospect ofmaking gain forthemselves.\\nThejoint conquest wasascramble forashare inthespoil. The\\nestablishment ofrival spheres ofgovernment wasthenatural\\nresult Theenterprise lostthecharacter ofonewhich aimed at\\nasystematic conquest.\\nYetthesuccess oftheLatins wasrapid, forthenative states\\nwere small anddisunited. Bytheendofthecentury, oralittle\\nlater, the first invaders, aided byfresh supports from theWest,\\nestablished inSyria fourprincipalities orstates. These embraced\\nnotonly thegreater part ofSyria, they included portions of\\nAsiaMinor andofMesopotamia. They arecalled bythenames\\noftheir capital cities, inorder from north tosouth, Edcssa,\\nAntioch, Tripolis andJerusalem. The political history ofthese\\nstates during theperiod oftheir existence isoneofconstant\\nstruggle with theMoslem princes opposed tothem. Their\\noriginal success wasdueonly tothedisunion oftheir enemies.\\nAfterwards they maintained themselves bythereinforcements\\nwhich came inaconstant stream from Europe. Their own\\nresources were unequal tothecontest.\\\" But interest waned in\\nEurope andanewTurko-Arab power rose toempire inthe\\nEast. Within ahundred years theendoftheLatin states\\nseemed imminent. Fragments oftheconquest survived another\\ncentury.

Anaccount oftheirsubsequent fortunes inSyriamay\\nbecalled thehistory ofthecrusaders intheEast.\\nThe_i[;i:usad£s were military expeditions toestablish and\\nmaintain aLatin power inSyria. They belong toaperiod\\nnearly co-extensive with two centuries, theI2thand 13th.\\nMany nationalities shared intheenterprise, butprincipally those\\nofWestern Europe. They joined together inthename of\\nobedience totheLatin Church. Two features inthemovement\\nareobscured bytheterms inpopular usewhen thecrusades are\\nspoken of.The first isthatWestern Europe wascontinuously\",\"THECRUSADES APART OFEASTERN HISTORY3\\natwarwith theMoslem East fornearly two centuries. The\\nsecond thatSyria isthestation fromwhich thecourse ofevents\\nshould bewatched;thecrusades areessentially achapter in\\nEastern history.\\nThecrusades have beennumbered asiftheywere aseries\\nwell-defined and easily counted. Some eight ofallthebands\\nandarmies which passed by^sea ^orja ndtoSyria have been\\nselected as\\\"theeight crusades. They arechosen onnoclear\\nprinciple. Those generally named arenotuniformly thelargest\\nnorthemost successful. Butwhyshould even sizeorsuccess\\nbemade thetest? Noexpedition which went tohelp the\\nLatins canberefused thename crusade.

Thenumbering ofaselected fewobscures this fact.\\nOnly the firstcrusade isrightly defined bythenumeral attached.\\nThemeaning isdefinite and thename appropriate. Similar\\nexpressions applied totheother crusades should seldom ornever\\nbeused.\\nAhistory ofthecrusades tohaveanorganic unity, after the\\ncommencement, must bewritten asahistory ofthecrusading\\nstates inSyria. Such treatment alone explains theriseand fall\\nofinterest intheWest, and gives toeach ofthegreater ex-\\npeditions anappropriate setting and itsfullsignificance. The\\ninfluence ofthesmaller expeditions isalsomost easily taken\\naccount ofinthisway. Every difficulty oftreatment isnot\\nindeed removed byadopting anEastern point ofview. The\\nproblem ofunifying thehistory ofthefourLatin states remains.\\nTheir first systematic historian wasWilliam ofTyre. His*^\\nmethod was tomake thekingdom ofJerusalem thecentre of\\ninterest. Hewas influenced bynational and religious con-\\nsiderations. Theother states were little tohim incomparison\\nwith hisown. Itscapital, besides, wasJerusalem, theholy city.\\nButthenorthern states, Edessa, while itexisted, andAntioch,\\nwere politically farmore important. They bore thebrunt of\\nMoslem attack, and their failure involved the failure of all.\\nAhistory oftheLatin kingdom ofJerusalem cannot bean\\nadequate treatment ofthepolitical history oftheLatin states.\\nIndeed iftheir external history istobeviewed asawhole, itis\",\"/S INTRODUCTION :\\nimportance. Without them, itmaybesaid, Syria could neither\\nhave beenconquered norheld forasingle year.\\nInsouthern Franc ealsotherewas^n element ofnational\\nhostility toaMoslem state. Several times inthelatter partof\\nthenthcentury thepeople there hadaided theChristians of\\nSpain intheir constant struggle with theMoors. The idea of\\nfederating Christendom towage aholywarmayhave gained\\nsomething from thisexample. Itwas insouthern France that\\nthecrusade was firstproclaimed. Itwasprobably theattitude\\nofsuchmen asRaymond ofToulouse thatencouraged thePope\\ntothefinal step.\\nInthese various wa.ys Western Europe \\\\yas._.prepared to\\nrespond toJhe^Pope's appeal- Butwhat,wehavenow toask,\\nsuggested thatappeal and leduptoit?Thegrowth ofpapal\\npower, the^establishment oftheTurkish empire and the\\nconsequent danger oftheByzantine emperors arealso*parts of\\nthepreparation forthecrusades. Among thedirect political\\ncauses ofthe firstcrusade theestablishment andgrowth ofthe\\nTurkish empire must begiven aforemost place. TheTurkish\\nadvance westward suggested and called forth aLatin counter\\nadvance eastward. Onemost prominent aspect ofthecrusades\\nisthatthey formed_a_baTriec_against Turkish advance. They\\norigmated indeed inanappeal which aimed atnothing further.\\nItwassenttothePopebytheRoman emperor ofthe H^ast, the\\nByzantine orGreek emperor. Itwasinspired byfearoffresh\\nTurkish conquests. The empire ofthe Seljuk Turks was\\nfounded under thevigorous ruleofthesultan Togrul Beg(1038).\\nItgradually absorbed theterritories ofthecaliphs ofBagdad.\\nItevenadded totheir extent, notably attheexpense ofthe\\nGreek empire. Within tenyears from thebattle ofManzikert\\n(1071) Asia Minor was practically over-run. Itwasonly\\nanother step toEurope and toConstantinople itself.\\nTheemperor turned forhelp totheWest.Common interest\\nandoldassociation might bepleaded. Christianity alsowasa\\nbond ofunion, fortheenemywereMoslem s.The request was\\ndirected tothePope asthehead oftheLatin Church, andof\\nthekingdoms oftheWest. Itcame tohimwhen andbecause\\nthePapacy wasprepared torespond. The_growth ofPapal\",\"THEIR ORIGIN9\\npower is^an essential partoQhe^reparatjojT_ forthecrusades.\\nThis_was theauthority which united theLatins intheir^enter^\\njprise. TheChurch hadentered ontheperiod ofitsgreatest\\ntemporal power. StepbystepthePopes hadgained aposition\\ninwhich theywere astruly thesuccessors oftheemperors of\\nRome asthosewhoclaimed the title. The great Hildebrand,\\nGregory VII,nowwore thepapal crown. Hehadformulated\\nwithout reserve hisdoctrine that every temporal power owes\\nobedience totheChurch, andtoitsearthly head, thePope. But\\nthiswasnoteasily established inpractice. Contests withHenry\\nIV,theWestern orGerman emperor, occupied much ofHilde-\\nbrand's energy. Hewasnever sufficiently free tosummon\\nEurope totheHolyWar. Hissuccessor wasaman ofdifferent\\ntemper, andduring hispontificate there was truce between\\nGreek andTurk. Thedelay wasnotwithout importance. In\\nthose years ofwaiting theemperor's suggestion matured inthe\\nwestern mind toanew conception. Palestine wasmore toit\\nthan Asia Minor.\\nThenextmotion came intheyear 1095. Itwasafavourable\\ntime foranaggressive movement inAsia Minor. The great\\nsultan Malik Shahhaddied (1092), andtheMoslem states were\\nplunged inendless confusion. With some helpfrom theLatins'\\ntheennperor Alexius (1081-1118) hoped easily torecover the\\nlostprovinces ofhisempire. Heappealed-to the,Eope-as-his\\npredecessarJiad^jone.

Inspite of\\nconflicts with theGerman emperor and others, hisposition\\nseemed secure enough. Without doubt hefirstconsulted some\\noftheleading princes. Then attheCouncil ofClermont in\\\"•\\nNovember 1095, heproclaimed hissummons tothepeople. Deus\\nlevolt,Deus levolt.Xh&y replied, deeply convinced that the call\\nwasdivine.

ThePopehadsummoned\\nChristian Europe tounite under thebanner oftheCross forthe\\nrelease ofJerusalem. Possibly thiswasnoteven apart of\\nAlexius' scheme. Therecovery ofAsiaMinor wascertainly his\\nprincipal object. HildebrandVthoughts hadalscTmoved inthat\\ndirection. Itseems that hismotive wasthehope ofextending\\nhispower ashead oftheChurch overtheChristians oftheEast»\\nGreek andArmenian.

Hiscapture ofEdessa in 1144wasthe firstgreat blow\\ninthedownfall oftheLatin states. HissonNureddin, sultan\\nofAleppo andafterwards ofDamascus, added Egypt tohis\\ndominions andthuscompletely altered thebalance ofpower in\\nSyria (1146-74). Thecapture ofAscalon bytheLatins (i153),\\nalthough important, wasanisolated event compared with the\\nsteady forward movement oftheMoslems during thissultanate,\\nespecially ontheborders ofAntioch. Then came Saladin\\n(1174-93) who almost swept theLatinsout ofSyria and\\neffectively maintained hisjground against thearmies ofEurope.\\nSaladin's dominions were divided after hisdeath and his\\nimmediate successors made concessions totheLatins forthe\\nsake ofpeace. Even Jerusalem which Saladin hadcaptured\\nwasrestored (1229-44). Thesultans ofEgypt, themost power-\\nfuloftheMoslem princes, preferred toavoid the riskofa\\nEuropean invasion andwere notambitious ofmaking conquests\\ninSyria.

Buttheprosperity of\",\"HISTORY OFTHELATIN STATES15\\ntheSyrian colonies wasonlyonematter ofinterest outofmany\\ntothepeoples and rulers oftheWest. When there wasacrisis\\ninthehistory oftheSyrian states itwasnotalways clear that it\\npossessed afirstclaim ontheattention ofLatin Europe. The\\nsending ofthe firstcrusade isspoken, ofasachallenge of\\nChristendom toIslam, buttherewasnofederated body which\\ncould beheld responsible forthe,defence ofthecrusading\\ncolonies. Theamount ofhelp given bythewestern states\\ndepended from time totime onthe political condition of\\nEurope andthefluctuating strength ofareligious ideal. Soon\\nafter thebeginning ofthe13thcentury itisclear thataturning\\npoint hasbeen reached andthattheperiod ofgreatest sacrifice\\nand effort intheWest isover. Enthusiasm wasdamped bythe\\npractical failure ofexpeditions forwhich every possible effort\\nseemed tohave been made. Sympathy fortheSyrian Latins\\ngave place toalienation. They hadacquired something ofthe\\ncharacter ofaneastern people andwere tainted besides, justas\\nmuch aswestern states, byselfishness andparty strife and\\nsecular ambition. Acentury's experience ofhard facts stripped\\ntheglamour from theHolyLand androbbed thecrusading\\nknights oftheir early halo. Accordingly astheneed ofthe\\nLatin states increased thehelp they received grew less.The\\ngreat crusades ofthe12thcentury were those which followed\\nthedownfall ofEdessa andthevictories ofSaladin. Butthe\\nfirstwas acomplete failure (1148-49) and thesecond only\\nchecked Saladin's career without really undoing hiswork\\n(1189-92). Thegreatest expedition ofthe13thcentury wasat\\ntheverycommencement andwasdirected totheconquest ofthe\\nByzantine empire (1202-04). The crusades ofFrederick II\\n(1228-29) andofTheobald andofRichard ofCornwall (1239-41)\\nwere important because oftheconcessions which they secured\\nrather thanbecause oftheir military strength. Theinvasion of\\nEgypt wastwice attempted andboth times wasanutter failure\\nowing totheignorance andmismanagement oftheleaders\\n(1218-2 1and1249-50). Inthelatter partofthe13thcentury\\ntheonly expedition ofconsequence wasthesecond crusade of\\nLouis IX,which spent itspower inTunis.;Onthewhole itis\\nremarkable how little these expeditions accomplished. The\",\"l6 INTRODUCTION :\\nrinain cause oftheir failure seems tohavebeen their international\\n/character and the inevitable dissensions resulting from it.\\n/Christendom wasnot suflficiently united toaccomplish thetask\\nI-thatwassetbefore it.\\ni^The internal causes oftheoverthrow oftheLatin states are\\nclear beyond dispute. The comparatively small number of\\ncrusaders permanently resident inSyria andthedissensions by\\nwhich theywere rentaretheprincipal factors inthecase. The\\nnumbers ofthosewhowent oncrusade totheHolyLand are\\nmuch exaggerated intheearly chronicles. Even ofthosewho\\nactually lefthome alargenumber never reached Syria, andof\\ntheremainder only asmall proportion settled intheEast. Thus\\ntheordinary population oftheLatin states, which always\\nincluded aconsiderable alienandMoslem element, was inferior\\natthebest totheopposing forces when these were themselves\\nunited. Thecalamitous effect ofthedivision oftheLatins into\\ni/ourprincedoms intheI2thcentury hasalready beenspoken of\\nInthe13thcentury theunion between theLatin towns wasso\\nslight that theirprolonged existence depended almost wholly on\\nthefavourable character oftheexternal political situation.\\nEven single cities were independent ofoneanother andmade\\nwarandpeace with theMoslems asthey pleased. Thestruggles\\nofthe Italian republics forsupremacy intheMediterranean\\nintroduced fresh elements ofdiscord. TheTemplars andthe\\nHospitallers, thechief military support ofthecolonies, were\\nantagonistic tooneanother. Rival claimants forthekingship\\nofJerusalem multiplied occasions ofcivilwarandcreated fresh\\n\\\"^parties inthestate. Allthese things nodoubt fostered selfish-\\nnessandbred indifference tothecommon cause, just asthe\\ncommercial instincts oftheItalians drewthem into alliance\\nLwiththeMoslem sultans. Itmay thusbeargued thatmoral\\ndeclension hastened thedecay andoverthrow oftheLatin states.\\nBut itisnottrue that theirdoom wascaused byanyextra-\\nordinary orexceptional corruption.

Besides, next year hisrelations withthesultan induced\\nhim toseek alliance with theLatin princes. Maudud wasthe\\nsultan's brother andTugtakin wassuspected ofcomplicity inhis\\ndeath.

There does notappear to\\nhavebeenanyfurther conflict between Damascus andJerusalem\\nuntil after Baldwin's death in 1118.\\nFrom thispoint thehistory ofevents inJerusalem need not\\nbenarrated separately from thehistory ofthenorthern states.\\nThe history ofthemaking ofthekingdom demanded separate\\ntreatment. Insouthern Syria theperiod ofconquest ends\\npractically with theyear 1112.Two important towns onthe\\ncoast wereindeed unsubdued. Tyrewasnotcaptured until 1124\\nandAscalon notuntil 1153.Butthese captures were isolated\\nevents. The failure oftheattack onTyre in1112marks the\\nendoftheperiod ofconquest. Thedate coincides remarkably\\nwith thecommencement ofawave ofMoslem advance. At\\nfirst thisadvance wasdirected against theLatins ofthenorth.\\nButatonce itaffected thesituation inJerusalem also. Baldwin\\nrecognised thepresence ofacommon enemy.

Affairs inthenorth\\ndemanded Baldwin's presence only once, intheyear 1115.There\\nwaspeace with Damascus, asalready observed. Nofurther\\nattempt wasmade toconquer Tyre, andAscalon was left\\nundisturbed. Theimmunity ofthecoast-towns may be\\nattributed toBaldwin's lack ofafleetand tothefailure ofhis\\ngreat effort inthewinter of1111-12.
