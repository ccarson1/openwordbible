The caliphs ofMekka\\nsucceeded tothesecular and spiritual position oftheProphet\\nMohammed (A.D. 632). Butthecountries over which they\\nclaimed authority were asdifficult tounite asEurope itself\\nNatural divisions oflandand race favoured separation. The\\ninherent authority ofthecaliphs was \\\"spiritual \\\"andtherefore\\nliable tobecome thatandnothing more. Disputes arose re-\\ngarding thelegitimate lineofsuccession, andthese opened the\\nway forschism. Thecombined effect ismanifest inthetime\\nofthe_Abbasit^ caliphs. They ruled inBagdad from theyear\\n750A.D.andwere atnotime sovereigns ofallIslam astheir\\npredecessors hadbeen. Within ahundred years their power\\nwas inprocess ofdecay. Private ambitions andtheaspirations\\nofconquered races sheltered themselves behind theclaims of\\nthe rival linewhich traced itsdescent from 'AH. Itwas in\\nNorth Africa, about thebeginning oftheloth century, that\\narival caliphate actually established itself, thatoftheFatinntes.\\nAbout 970A.D.Egypt wasconquered bythese new caliphs.\\nThe greater part ofSyria, also, soon passed into their hands,\\nandcontinued theirs until theTurkish conquest. Atthesame\\ntime thepower oftheAbbasite caTiphs inBagdad passed to\\nforeign dynasties, who acknowledged only their spiritual\\nsupremacy.\",\"FIRST CRUSADE19\\nInthe 11thcentury theMoslem Eastwasunited byanother\\npower than thatofthecaHphs. The firstTurkish empire was^\\nestablished bytheSeljuk Turks. From 1038 to1092 they\\nwere ruledbythree sultans ofexceptional ability, whoprofessed\\nIslam, acknowledged theAbbasite caliph, andoncemoremade\\nBagdad theseatofeffective government. Their conquests in\\nsome directions exceeded theboundaries ofthecaliphate which\\ntheyprofessed torestore. They recovered Syria almost entirely,\\nalthough they didnotsucceed intheir attempt onEgypt itself. J\\nButtheir empire alsowasfated todissolution. Alldepended\\nontheindividual ability ofthesultan. Even hisown emirs\\nrecognised hisauthority only solong ashehadstrength to\\ncompel them. TheTurks were asmall minority inthelands\\nthey ruled, andeven thecaliph wasnotalways thesultan's\\nfriend. When therefore Malik Shah died in1092and hisdeathâ€”,\\nwasfollowed bytwelve years ofalmost continuous dynastic\\nstrife, the result was inevitable. The Seljuk empire fellto |\\npieces. InSyria every town ofanyconsequence was freeto I\\ngoitsownway. InAsiaMinor thesultanate ofRum entered\\nonaperiod ofcomplete independence.-'^\\nItwasjust atthis critical time that thecrusade rspassed\\nthroiJgh_ AsiaJMinor into Syria. They had little tofearfrom\\ntheTurkish sultans. Mohammed wasthesonofMalik Shah\\nwho ultimately secured thesuccession, after thedeath ofhis\\nbrother and rivalBark-yarok in1104.Hewasacompetent ruler,\\nbuttheLatin states were already established andMohammed\\nnever took the field against them inperson. After hisdeath\\nin 1118,thesultanate wasfurther divi^ed^ HisbrotheFSTnjar\\nruled inthefareast until 1157,unconcerned about Syria.

His policy was tostrengthen Egypt internally\\nrather than toextend itsconquests inSyria. When hedied\\nin1094 hissonShah-an-shah el-afdal succeeded tohisposition.\\nItwashewhoguided thepolicy ofEgypt attheadvent ofthe\\nfirst crusade. Itseems likely thathemistook their intentions\\nforatime. They landed inAsia Minor, andtheyhadcome\\nattherequest oftheGreek emperor tohisassistance. They\\nseemed welladapted toweaken thepower oftheTurks. So\\nfarfrom combining against them, El-afdal wasprepared to\\nmake alliance with them. Hehoped theywould becontent\\nwith their conquests inthenorth andleave Palestine toEgypt.\\nAfter newscame ofthe fallofAntioch hecaptured Jerusalem\\nfrom itsTurkish governor, inthesummer ofI098^ The\\ncrusaders delayed theirmarch toPalestine forseveral months,\\nand thismayhave deceived him further. Itwasnotuntil after\\nthesiege andcapture ofJerusalem thatanEgyptian army\\nentered Palestine tooppose thecrusaders. Itwas surprised\\nanddefeated atAscalon. After this forafewyears theport\\nofJaffawasconstantly menaced bythegarrison ofAscalon\\naided byfleets from Eg^pt, buttheonly occasion onwhich\\nEl-afdal sentastrong army intoSyria was intheyear 1105.\\nHaving again been defeated inthisyear hemade nofurther\\nserious attempt toinvade thecountry. Even thesupport\\nwhich hegave totheMoslem coast-towns wasuncertain and\\nineffective. The prosperity ofEgypt was little affected bythe\\npresence oftheLatins, andthecircumstances ofitsdomestic\\naffairs were notfavourable tothecarrying onofforeign wars.\\nEl-afdal died inDecember 1121andfrom thattimeEgypt was\\ntooweak totake theoffensive.\\nTheestablishment oftheSeljuk sultanate ofRum hasbeen\\nalready alluded to.

But after thatdateAsiaMinor wasrapidly\\nover-run. Within tenyears thegreater partofitwassubdued\\nbytheTurks. Theyestablished their capital atNicea, which-\\nwas atnogreat distance from Constantinople itself. Itwas\\nfearofthisnewpower thatdrove Alexius toappeal forhelp\\ntothekings ofWestern Christendom. The firstMoslems witlT\\nwhom thecrusaders measured arms were thesoldiers ofKilij\\nArslan ofRum (1092-1107). Their success profoundly in-\\nfluenced theposition oftheGreek empire inAsia Minor. It\\nmaybesaid tohave delayed theTurkish invasion ofEurope\\nforthree centuries andahalf. Within afewyears ofthe\\ncapture ofNicea, inJune 1097, Alexius regained nearly half\\nofAsia Minor. Thegeographical position ofthenewMoslem\\ncapital, Iconium, marks thedifference inthe situation. But\\nthesultanate ofRum^pes notplay agreat part inthehistory\\noftheLatinsthem^RW Thegoal ofthecrusade laybeyond\\nAsia Minojpand thedominions ofKilij Arslan. After the\\nstrength ^fthe crusaders hadbeenshown atDoryleum, Kilij\\nArslan's policy was toseethem safely outofhisdominions.\\nTheir occupation ofSyria concerned him little. Hewas\\nprotected from them bytheranges oftheTaurus. His\\nattention besides was fully occupied byhiscontest with the\\nGreeks. Inthat theLatins took nofurther share. They\\nregarded theservice theyhadrendered theemperor asmerely\\nincidental totheaccomplishment oftheirownpurposes.\\nThemainbody ofthecrusaders didnotdirectly continue\\ntheirmarch toSyria after theyhadpassed the territories of\\nKilij Arslan. AtHeraclea, themodern Eregli, they turned\\nsharply north andmade along detour through Armenia Minor.\\nInthis district there wasnopowerful ruler orsovereign to\\noppose them. Nominally itwassubject tothesultan ofBagdad,\\nwhose intervention wasonlyaremote contingency. Thepresence\\nofalarge andfriendly Armenian population wasthecardinal\\nfeature ofthesituation. These Christians hadbeen driven by\\ntheTurks from their oldhomes bysufferings such asagain\\nrecently have been their lotinArmenia Minor, theirnewhome.\\nThey occupied theTaurus ranges andthecountry tothewest\",\"22 FIRST CRUSADE\\nand east, portions ofCilicia, western Mesopotamia, andEuphra-\\ntepia, orthecountry between theEuphrates andtheTaurus'.\\nTheborder lands between AsiaMinor andMesopotamia were\\nrecent Turkish conquests and imperfectly subdued. Thdre\\nwere stilltowns and castles heldbyGreek andArmenian\\ngovernors, andeven thebeginnings ofanewArmenian prince-\\ndom. Without doubt thesituation wasknown from the first\\ntosome oftheLatin chiefs. Themere presence oftheLatin\\narmy was sufficient tosecure thecountry. Itsmarch north-\\nwards away from thegoal ofthecrusade isexplained bythese\\nfacts. The assistance rendered totheArmenian towns was\\namply rewarded. The crusaders found welcome allies anda\\nbase ofoperations against Syria proper.\\nItwas inArmenian territ oryalsothattheLatins made their\\nfifsTTettiements, andfounded their first state, thatofEdessa.\\nThere was^ar^ectFoTi ofIKeCrusaders whicTi crossed directly\\ninto Cilicia from Heraclea. Itisnot Jiftogether certain that\\nthiswaspartofaconcerted plan. Although itwa^tjpth prudent\\nand feasible foraportion ofthecrusade tooccupy Cilicia,\\nprivate ambitions mayhave ledtotheseparation. Tancred,\\nitmay be,wascommissioned byBohemond tosecure the\\nprovince fortheNormans. Baldwin, whether byaccident or\\nintention, followed close athisheels anddisputed possession\\nwith him. AtTarsus where therivals met there wasabitter\\nquarrel, and atMamistra there was actual fighting. Finally\\nBaldwin lefttheNorman inCilicia\\\" andwent totryhisfortune\\ninthedistrict ofTellbashir neartheEuphrates. Hefollowed\\n*Regarding thiscountry andpeople, seeEd.Dulaurier inRecueii Hist.Arm. i.\\n*Neither Tancred's conquests after Baldwin's departure northetime thathespent\\ninCilicia areexactly specified bythesources.

Butthese dates arecalculated from estimates\\nofdistances and rates ofmarching andhere they conflict with theonlydocumentary\\nevidence, which isthatofKemal ed-din (see p.25,n.5).The details oftheconflicts\\natTarsus andMamistra aregiven from therival points ofviewbytheGesta Tancredi,\\ncc.34-44. andAlbert iii.5-17.

Presumably hewished toconsult hisbrother\\nGodfrey and tostrengthen his forces. Heseparated again\\nfrom themain body ashort distance south ofMar'ash, and\\nwhilst they proceeded tothesiege ofAntioch hebegan the\\noccupation ofTell bashir (October 1097). Hisrapid progress\\ninthisneighbourhood during thefollowing months was less\\nduetoactual conquest than torevolts oftheArmenian popu-\\nlation and totreaties with thegovernors ofArmenian towns.\\nMany likePakrad's brother welcomed thecrusader asadeliverer\\nfrom theMoslem yoke. The inevitable friction between the\\nnew settlers andtheolder inhabitants didnotyetmuch affect\\nthesituation ^Inthebeginning of1098 theLatins gained a\\nfooting ontheeastern side oftheEuphrates, andthetown of\\n^Albert iii.17.Tyre vii.5shows thatthe\\\"Corrovassil \\\"ofAlbert v.13-14 was\\nPakrad's brother. Basil's towns wereRa'ban andKaisun (Michael i.330).\\n-There isnocertainty regarding whatBaldwin wasdoing whilst Tancred secured\\nCilicia andcarried onhiscampaign against thecastles nearAntioch (p.25,n.5).The\\nGesta Tancredi, cc.45-47, relates thatheproceeded from Cilicia toArtah, ofwhich\\nhebecame master andwhere hehadtodefend himself against Moslem attacks. Ifso,\\nthismust bereckoned part ofhisprojected campaign inArmenian territory. But\\nArtah liesonly20miles north-west ofAleppo near theriver 'Afrin ontheroad to\\nIskanderun, quiteaway from theTellbashir district withwhich according even tothe\\nevidence oftheGesta Tancredi, ch.42(Rec. iii.637),Baldwin hadbeen incommunica-\\ntion atTarsus, Possibly theGesta gives Baldwin's name wrongly forsome other,\\ne.g.thatofRaymond ofToulouse (cf.p.25,n.5).Albert iii.28-31 attributes the\\noccupation ofArtah tothemainarmy asitcame south butKemal ed-din rather\\nsupports anearlier date (p.25,n.5).Except fortheevidence oftheGesta Tancredi\\nthere isnodifficulty insupposing thatBaldwin when heleftCilicia found himself\\ninsufficiently equipped forhisnew enterprise andresolved toawait thearrival ofthe\\nmainarmy which heknew would soon passthrough Mar'ash. The interval might\\nstillbeemployed innegotiations with theArmenians ofthedistrict. Fulcher i.6and\\nTyre iii.25favour theview thatBaldwin came toMar'ash directly from Cilicia.\\n^Baldwin andPakrad soonbecame enemies andtheArmenian sought alliance\\nwithBohemond (Albert iii.18,iv.9,v.13-14).

There does notappear to\\nhavebeenanyfurther conflict between Damascus andJerusalem\\nuntil after Baldwin's death in 1118.\\nFrom thispoint thehistory ofevents inJerusalem need not\\nbenarrated separately from thehistory ofthenorthern states.\\nThe history ofthemaking ofthekingdom demanded separate\\ntreatment. Insouthern Syria theperiod ofconquest ends\\npractically with theyear 1112.Two important towns onthe\\ncoast wereindeed unsubdued. Tyrewasnotcaptured until 1124\\nandAscalon notuntil 1153.Butthese captures were isolated\\nevents. The failure oftheattack onTyre in1112marks the\\nendoftheperiod ofconquest. Thedate coincides remarkably\\nwith thecommencement ofawave ofMoslem advance. At\\nfirst thisadvance wasdirected against theLatins ofthenorth.\\nButatonce itaffected thesituation inJerusalem also.

There is\",\"A.D.III4-I6 BALDWIN I65\\nlittle ofnote orimportance torecord. Affairs inthenorth\\ndemanded Baldwin's presence only once, intheyear 1115.There\\nwaspeace with Damascus, asalready observed. Nofurther\\nattempt wasmade toconquer Tyre, andAscalon was left\\nundisturbed. Theimmunity ofthecoast-towns may be\\nattributed toBaldwin's lack ofafleetand tothefailure ofhis\\ngreat effort inthewinter of1111-12. OntheMoslem sidethe\\nEgyptian garrison ofAscalon was never wholly inactive.\\nDuring theinvasion ofMaudud in1113anexpedition from\\nAscalon threatened thetown ofJerusalem ^Again when\\nBaldwin wasabsent inthenorth in1115twoattempts were\\nmade tosurprise Jaffa (beginning ofSeptember).
