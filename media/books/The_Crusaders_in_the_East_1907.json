    "published_book": "[\"PREFACE. THE subject of the following pages is less, and more, than a history of the crusades. It is a history of the political relations between the states which the crusaders founded and those Moslem states with which they waged war, or a history of the struggle between the Latins and the Moslems in Syria during the I2th and 13th centuries. In the treatment of this subject the eastern point of view has been emphasised and the main thread of the narrative is drawn, as far as possible, from the historyofthe Moslem states. The stress laidon the eastern point of view, and the special attention paid to the chronology of the period, may be held to justify a new work on the subject. In the narrative the writer endeavours to trace the course of events from year to year as closely as the sources permit. Somemarkedvariations inthefulnessoftreatmentare explained by differences in the fulness of the available sources. In the notes the requirements offuture investigators and ofthe editors of new texts have been particularly kept in view. The writer's special contribution to the chronology of the period is drawn from Arabic sources and the critical methods applied to these sources are the subject of appendix A. Some new suggestions regarding the chronology of William of Tyre are offered in appendix B. The minor corrections of accepted dates made throughout the work are very numerous and results ofwider im- portance may be held to have been established in a considerable number ofcases for the first time.0\",\"VI PREFACE Chapters I and II, containing the history of the Latin conquest, describe the course of events necessarily more from the side of the Latins than of the Moslems and the detailed narrative of chapter VI is limited to the periods when there was war between the Moslems and their opponents. While the history in chapter VI is sketched more broadly than in the earlier chapters, attention may be called to the fresh contribu- tions offered in the treatment, for example, of the crusades of Theobald of Navarre, Richard of Cornwall and Frederick II. The writer owes his interest in the subject of this volume, and his conception of the history of the crusades as part of the history of the Moslem east, to the late Sir William Muir, K.C.S.I. As Principal of Edinburgh University he pointed out the opportunity for research in this department and in response to his invitation thepresent writerwastheauthorofa University Prize Essay on thesubject. The list ofbookson pages 372-376 may be regarded as an acknowledgment of the writer's debt to the modern authors who are there mentioned. W. B. STEVENSON. Bala, 2 August 1907.1\",\"—— CONTENTS.

Late in the summerof 1097 an invadingarmyentered Syria. It streamed out in bands from Asia Minor and the gates of the Taurus. The invaders came from Western Europe and were the soldiersofthefirst \\\"European concert.\\\" Buttheirenterpriseitself was no novelty. Syria is a stage which wajts_from century to century for a repetition of the same drama. Its destiny is^to be invaded and_to be conquered. Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian, Persian, Greek, Roman, Arab, Turk, a long succession of aliens have been the makersofSyrian history. The land is geographi- callydistinct, anatural unity,yet the people haveJiever_achieyed the unityofa national state. Theircentral and exposed position invites attack,,. The mountains which crowd the land from north to south have favoured the growth of petty city-states and kingdoms. And so the Syrians have always been a people ready to perish. Syria in 1097 was not effectively part of any empire. Its latest cormu^ors^iJie^SeJjukJ[jnjcs, were engaged in civil war. Every city ruler was prince again for the time. The cities seldom or never change, so that the city-states of^he_4Der]od are^those also of older times. Damascus, Jerusalem, H^math (Hama), Tyre, Aleppo (Haleb) and Antioch are among the most important. Disunity was their fatal weakness, in spite of many advantages which they possessed. The defence of fortified towns against attack was even easier then than now. The invaders were far from their nearest base of supplies, and were not themselves united. They had taken the Sign of the Cross as a symbol of that which they had in common, the Latin form of Christianity. But international jealousy and rival am\\\"bitIons s. c.8\",\"INTRODUCTION marred their concert. They had combined to make a conquest, but without any agreement regarding the future division or government of the country. The leaders were in full earnest only where there was a prospect of making gain for themselves. Thejoint conquest was a scramble for a share in the spoil. The establishment of rival spheres of government was the natural result The enterprise lost the character of one which aimed at a systematic conquest. Yet the success of the Latins was rapid, for the native states were small and disunited. By the end of the century, or a little later, the first invaders, aided by fresh supports from the West, established in Syria fourprincipalitiesorstates. Theseembraced not only the greater part of Syria, they included portions of Asia Minor and ofMesopotamia. They are called by the names of their capital cities, in order from north to south, Edcssa, Antioch, Tripolis and Jerusalem. The political history of these states during the period of their existence is one of constant struggle with the Moslem princes opposed to them. Their original success was due only to the disunion of their enemies. Afterwards they maintained themselves by the reinforcements which came in a constant stream from Europe. Their own resources were unequal to the contest.\\\" But interest waned in Europe and a new Turko-Arab power rose to empire in the East. Within a hundred years the end of the Latin states seemed imminent. Fragments of the conquest survived another century. It is a time of expiring interest in the West, and in the East one of waiting for the end. The history of,the e^- tablishnient qf^heJLatin&JiLthe Ea&t isJtJie history of the first crusade. An account of their subsequent fortunes in Syria may be called the history ofthe crusaders in the East. The_i[;i:usad£s were military expeditions to establish and maintain a Latin power in Syria. They belong to a period nearly co-extensive with two centuries, the I2th and 13th. Many nationalities shared in the enterprise, but principallythose of Western Europe. They joined together in the name of obedience to the Latin Church. Two features in the movement are obscured by the terms in popular use when the crusades are spoken of. The first is that Western Europe was continuously9\",\"THE CRUSADES A PART OF EASTERN HISTORY 3 at war with the Moslem East for nearly two centuries. The second that Syria is the station from which the course of events should be watched ; the crusades are essentially a chapter in Eastern history. The crusades have been numbered as if they were a series well-defined and easily counted. Some eight of all the bands and armies which passed by^sea^orjand to Syria have been selected as \\\"the eight crusades. They are chosen on no clear principle. Those generally named are not uniformly the largest nor the most successful. But why should even size or success be made the test? No expedition which went to help the Latins can be refused the name crusade. Together they form a continuous stream for the greater part of the 12th and 13th \\\"/ centuries. The numbering of a selected few obscures this fact. Only the first crusade is rightly defined bythe numeral attached. The meaning is definite and the name appropriate. Similar expressions applied to the other crusades should seldom ornever be used. A history of the crusades to have an organic unity, after the commencement, must be written as a history of the crusading states in Syria. Such treatment alone explains the rise and fall of interest in the West, and gives to each of the greater ex- peditions an appropriate setting and its full significance. The influence of the smaller expeditions is also most easily taken account of in this way. Every difficulty of treatment is not indeed removed by adopting an Eastern point of view. The problem ofunifying the history of the four Latin states remains. Their first systematic historian was William of Tyre. His *^ method was to make the kingdom of Jerusalem the centre of interest. He was influenced by national and religious con- siderations. The other states were little to him in comparison with his own. Its capital, besides, was Jerusalem, the holy city. But the northern states, Edessa, while it existed, and Antioch, were politically far more important. They bore the brunt of Moslem attack, and their failure involved the failure of all. A history of the Latin kingdom of Jerusalem cannot be an adequate treatment of the political history of the Latin states. Indeed if their external history is to be viewed as a whole, it is10\",\"S INTRODUCTION : importance. Without them, it may be said, Syria could neither have been conquered nor held for a single year. In southern France also there was^n element of national hostility to a Moslem state. Several times in the latter part of the nth century the people there had aided the Christians of Spain in their constant struggle with the Moors. The idea of federating Christendom to wage a holy war may have gained something from this example. It was in southern France that the crusade was first proclaimed. It was probably the attitude ofsuch men as Raymond of Toulouse that encouraged the Pope to the final step. In these various wa.ys Western Europe \\\\yas._.prepared to respond toJhe^Pope's appeal- But what, we have now to ask, suggested that appeal and led up to it? The growth ofpapal power, the^ establishment of the Turkish empire and the consequent danger of the Byzantine emperors are also*parts of the preparation for the crusades. Among the direct political causes of the first crusade the establishment and growth of the Turkish empire must be given a foremost place. The Turkish advance westward suggested and called forth a Latin counter advance eastward. One most prominent aspect of the crusades is that they formed_a_baTriec_against Turkish advance. They origmated indeed in an appeal which aimed at nothing further. It was sent to the Pope by the Roman emperor of the H^ast, the Byzantine or Greek emperor. It was inspired by fear of fresh Turkish conquests. The empire of the Seljuk Turks was founded under the vigorous ruleofthesultan Togrul Beg(1038). It gradually absorbed the territories of the caliphs of Bagdad. It even added to their extent, notably at the expense of the Greek empire. Within ten years from the battle of Manzikert (1071) Asia Minor was practically over-run. It was only / another step to Europe and to Constantinople itself. The emperor turned for help to the West. Common interest and old association might be pleaded. Christianity also was a bond of union, for the enemy were Moslem s. The request was directed to the Pope as the head of the Latin Church, and of the kingdoms of the West. It came to him when and because the Papacy was prepared to respond. The_growth of Papal11\",\"THEIR ORIGIN 9 power is^an essential part oQhe^reparatjojT_for the crusades. This_was the authority which united the Latins in their^enter^ j prise. The Church had entered on the period of its greatest temporal power. Step by step the Popes had gained a position in which they were as truly the successors of the emperors of Rome as those who claimed the title. The great Hildebrand, Gregory VII, now wore the papal crown. He had formulated without reserve his doctrine that every temporal power owes obedience to the Church, and to its earthlyhead, the Pope. But this was not easily established in practice. Contests with Henry IV, the Western or German emperor, occupied much of Hilde- brand's energy. He was never sufficiently free to summon Europe to the Holy War. His successor was a man ofdifferent temper, and during his pontificate there was truce between Greek and Turk. The delay was not without importance. In those years of waiting the emperor's suggestion matured in the western mind to a new conception. Palestine was more to it than Asia Minor. The next motion came in the year 1095. It was a favourable time for an aggressive movement in Asia Minor. The great sultan Malik Shah had died (1092), and the Moslem states were plunged in endless confusion. With some help from the Latins' the ennperor Alexius (1081-1118) hoped easily to recover the lost provinces of his empire. He appealed-to the,Eope-as-his predecessarJiad^jone. Urban II occupied the chair of Hilde-^ brandj_and renewed hisj)olk:y. He felt the power of the call to engage the armies of the Church in a holy war. In spite of conflicts with the German emperor and others, his position seemed secure enough. Without doubt he first consulted some of the leading princes. Then at the Council of Clermont in \\\"• November 1095, he proclaimed his summonsto thepeople. Deus le volt, Deus le volt.Xh&y replied, deeply convinced that the call was divine.

Popular thought seeks to explain every great12\",\"INTRODUCTION : vailed. But neither Pope nor people gave much heed to the serviceasked bythe Eastern emperor. The Popehad summoned Christian Europe to unite under the banner of the Cross for the release of Jerusalem. Possibly this was not even a part of Alexius' scheme. The recovery of Asia Minor was certainly his principal object. HildebrandVthoughts had alscTmoved in that direction. It seems that his motive was the hope of extending his power as head ofthe Church over the Christians of the East» Greek and Armenian. He was prepared to help the Greek empire in return for acknowledgment of the see of Rome. Pope Urban, by the form of his appeal, inaugurated another movement. By his official action, whatever his personal share in the matter*, he gave the Latins a cause which was inde- pendent of the need of the Byzantine empire. It suited better the policy and position of the Church and the temper which inspired Latin Christendom. War with the infidel for its own sake and for the release of Jerusalem was the purpose to which they vowed themselves. The crusade so conceived was not merely an adoption ofAlexius' proposal, though still capable of attaining some of its objects. There was to be war with the Turks. The expedition was to start from Constantinople. Syria was to be conquered, and a Christian state established there. The Greek empire must gain directly. If Syria were handed over to Alexius it would also gain indirectly. But there is no evidence that even the Pope intended this. The Latin leaders certainly hoped to establish princedoms for themselves. event by the initiative and achievement of some one individual. The necessary criticism of thesources will befound in H. Hagenmeyer's Peter der Heremite. In the legend Peter represents the supernatural agency which early writers believed to be the real cause of the crusading movement (Hagenmeyer). * In March 1095 at the council of Piacenza, Urban is reported to have made appealsforhelpagainsttheTurkson behalfofAlexius. Theprojectforadeliverance of the Holy Land does not come to the surface until the Council of Clermont in November. Itisacconlinglypossiblethat therulingconception of a crusade forthe deliverance of Jerusalem and the Holy Land was definitely formulated for the first time in the interval between these two councils.

The first^rusade had one aspect in the m ind of Alexius, another in the heart^f the Pop e. There is a third aspect which comes nearer than the others to the true character of thejjy crusade as estimated by its actual results. It was a joint expedition for the conquest and partition, of Syria. In this aspect the most important features are the composite character of the crusade, and the rivalry of its leaders. There was no supreme authority to direct the army and its movements. The Papal Legate has most claim to be regarded as formally at the head of the expedition. But in military matters each chief claimed the right to act for himself When the leaders met^in council national jealousy and suspiciQn_disturbed their delibera- tions. The key to an understanding of the issue of the crusade is a knowledge ofits national elements and ofitsvarious leaders. The conspicuous elements are three in number, Provencals, or southern French, Normans from Sicily and the north of France and Burgundians or the men of Lorraine. ^QfJheFrenchmen. _ perhaps the most notable was the wealthy and powerful prince ^r«^cJ Raymond ofToulouse. It was said that he had vowed to spend theTest ofhis days in the East. There need be no doubt ofhis religious^mcerity. But_of^in;seJie_counte^^ Jn_xQIiquered Syria as he had been at home. The spirit of the Norman has been described already. Robert of Normandy , \\\\Ji^Cr.-^ eldest son of the Conqueror, was weak and without much influence. The foremost Norman chiefs were from Sicily. Bohemond, son of Robert Guiscard, was the ablest and the most ambitious. He possessed exceptional military and political capacity. He knew better than any other the situation in the East. He had nothing to lose at home, and the crusade offered him that very opportunity which his ambition desired. His reputation and ability gathered round him an army far beyond his slender means. He aimed at a princedom in Antioch . Tancred was Bohemond's nephew* and his successor as prince 1 Tancredwas Bohemond's nephewaccording toAlbertii. 19, Mt. Ed. i. 50, and Ekk.p.329.

The Burgundian leaders were two brothers and a nephew. Godfrey was the futurejarince of Jerusalem. Round him therefore legend has wound her fairest garlands. It is the more difficult to estimate his position as a leader ofthe crusade. He does not seem to have stood quitein the foremost rank. But his position was strengthened by his brother Baldwin, founder of the first Latin state, Edessa. Their nephew, another BaldwiiC also played alTimpoftantpart in the after history. It is instructive to note how the Normans and Burgundians seem to race and jostle for their princedoms as they approach the borders of ( Syria. What may be termed the official purpose of the^crusade was \\\"^ necessarily something more than the deliverance of Jerusalem and the Holy Sepulchre. If these were to be permanently secured for Christendom it was essential that they should become part ofa Christian state. This was certainly recognised by the responsible leaders of the movement. Presumably they also assumed that the new state would be occupied and main- tained by western colonists and knights, whatever their relation to the Greek emperor might be. The goal of the first crusade^ therefore, was the establishnient of a J-atin ,powerJruSyria. Had the crusaders been of one nationality or even had they recognised the authority of one sovereign the result might have been the establishment of a single state in the conquered terri- tories. But the conflictmg_ambitions ofJthe-l-atin chiefs and the jealousies ofthe national elements which were represented made that^ impossible. Of course Jerusalem was to be delivered. That was every man's business. But the immediate object to which each leader gave his separate attention was the winning of a princedom,jbi^ himself . Neither Bohemond of Antioch nor Baldwin of Edessa took any part in the capture of Jerusalem. They were too much engaged with the affairs of their own territories in northern Syria. Theaim of thejeaders stamps the character of the crusade. Effectively -it- was aa^nterprise for of the words \\\"cognatus Boamundi\\\" which are found in several of the sources (Hagenmeyer, £kk.).15\",\"_ RELATION TO THE GREEK EMPIRE II the conquest_and partition QL-Svria. Only in this light can we understand the history of the invasion. Whenever the emperor Alexius realised the vast extent of the response made to his appeal he realised also the danger that threatened him fromTiis^IIiesr It was clear that the popular uprising in western Europe cared nothing for the safety of his empire^^ It^was unlikely that so powerful a\\\"Host would submit to act merely as his auxiliaries, hie had been\\\"^t-w«rribt\\\"nTany years^?gviously~with the'T^ormans of Sicily, who were strongly represented among the crusaders. Such being the situation Alexiusjused every device to secure that the expedition, so far as possible, should still play the part he had originally designed for it. As the leaders of the crusade arrived in Constantinople one after another, the emperor demanded of them an oath that they would hand over to the Greeks all their conquests of cities and territories that had formerly belonged to the empire. Pre- sumablythe districts referred to were those which the Turks had recently occupied and did not include the land of Palestine. Perhaps most of the leaders when they took the oath had Asia Minor chiefljMn^view. The emperor promised in exchange militarysupport to the expedition and assistance in provisioning the army. His advice regarding a march through Asia Minor was certainly of value, and many of the crusaders were in need of the pecuniary assistance he was able to give. Conflicts^ between the Greeks and the hosts of strangers who passed through their territories were of course inevitable. Suspicion V and discord arose between the emperorhimselfand his supposed J allies. But with surprisingly little difficulty Alexius secured from most ofthe prominent leaders the oath which he asked for. Only Raymond of Toulouse refused point blank. Even he sw^re thaOie woulddo notFfng against the life or the honour of the emperor. With that Alexius had to be content. The route to Palestine from Constantinople lay through Asia n(^ Minor. The passage of the crusade occupied the greater part of the summer of 1097. Its victorious progress paved the way for the restoration to the Greeks of all the western part of the peninsula. Nicea^^as the only city in the west which the crusaders themselves besieged. It was surrendered on the 29th16\",\"12 INTRODUCTION: of June after a siege of somewhat more than a month. Con- siderable discontent was caused by the action of Alexius' representative who negotiated the surrender and took possession of the town without consultation or arrangement with the Latin chiefs. Only one pitched battle was fought during the whole march through Asia Minor, at Doryleum on the ist of July. From this point a small Greek force accompanied the crusaders, while Alexius himself proceeded to the recovery of his former possessions in the west. So far the crusade accomplished what the emperor had designed it should. Further east, in Cilicia and Euphratesia, the Latins made their first conquests for themselves. An tioch and the towns of Cilicia were secured by Bohemond and T ancred, the hereditary enemies ofthe Greeks. Antioch had belonged to the empire as recently as the year 1085. After the final victory of the crusaders just outside the city, in July 1098, a majority of the leaders were ready to hand over the town and district to the emperor, provided he came to take possession with the army he had promised. Unfortunately for his own interests he had turned back some time previously when bad news reached him of the progress of the crusade. His conduct exposed him to a charge of breach of failk^ind^^f-iailureJo carry out his^part of the arrangement made in Constantinople. In all probability these occurrences~suTte3T^ohemond's intentions admirably. Being in possession of Antioch he decisively refused to acknow- ledge the emperor's claim. Thus the antagonism between Greek and Latin passes into another stage. In Bohemond's lifetime, and long afterwards, it was a prominent part of the emperor's policy to wrest Cilicia and Antioch from the Latins. The r recurrence of war with Greece distracted the Normans of Antioch at more than one crisis in their struggle with the Moslems. Inevitably this breach between the Greeks and the Latins affected the whole history of the crusading movement. ^It culminated in the Latin conquest and occupation of Con- stantinople (i204-1261). In the thirteenth century it drew the interest and the attention of Western Europe away from the Latin states and was partly responsible for the small amount of help that was given them during their last struggle with the17\",\"THE MEASURE OF THEIR(SUCCESS J 13 Moslems. It was a fatal destiny that linlceH^e fortunes of ^ the crusades with the history of the Greek empire. The actual conquests of the first crusade in Syria were not )<^ numerous^^^After the^captuFe^f Antioch m thelfdrth and of^ JerusaTerrTlnlthe south its force was practically spent. The creation of the Latin states was the work of a quarter of a century or more. It was accomplished by crusaders who re- mained in the east, with the assistance of pilgrim bands, which came regularly from Europe, generally twice a year, before Easter and in the summer. Considering the small numbers of the western colonists their progress in a comparatively short time is striking. But the growth ofthe Latin states was checked before Syria was subdued. Palestine was conquered and ulti- mately the coast of Syria with the hills stretching parallel to it at a short distance inland. Parts of Gilicia and of the country in the neighbourhood of Edessa w — ere also occupied. But at1~-r\\\\ the important inland townsofSyria Aleppo, Hama, Homs,and — \\\\\\\\ Damascus remained in Moslem hands. Possibly the rise of ^ Zanki of Mosul made the failure of the Latins inevitable. 3jJt their division into four_Blincedoms or petty states was a serious ^^ hindrance to their success,. The origin of these separate states is ^ear. They were due to the international character of the first crusade and to the rivalries of its chiefs. Edessa and Jerusalem were Burgundian princedoms, Antioch was Norman, and Tripolis Provencal. The discord of the founders was perpetuated in the history of their successors. They failed to co-operate at critical times and even engaged occasionally in open war. The dissensions of the Syrian states, added to the dissensions of the Greeks and Latins, crippled their aggressive power at the very time when their Moslem foes were weakest and they themselves were most enthusiastic. The short period of rapid progress is succeeded by a longer period of slow Moslem recovery and advance. It covers the greater part of the twelfth century and culminates in the achievements of Saladm At Saladin's death the Moslems were . again predominant in Syria and so they remained. The history of the crusaders in the east extends over the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, but the events of the thirteenth century18\",\"14 INTRODUCTION : are only an epilogue to what precedes. The Latin towns more and more assume the character of colonial trading centres with- out much religious or political importance. Their independence is preserved rather by the forbearance of Saladin's successors than by their own power. So feeble is their last resistance that some insidious unseen disease might seem to have wasted them away. Symptoms of the Moslem reaction of the 12th century appear as early as the year 11 10. But Zanki, atabek of Mosul (1127-46), was the first to face the Latins on more than equal V terms. His capture of Edessa in 1 144 was the first great blow in the downfall of the Latin states. His son Nureddin, sultan of Aleppo and afterwards of Damascus, added Egypt to his dominions and thus completely altered the balance of power in Syria (1146-74). The capture of Ascalon by the Latins (i 153), although important, was an isolated event compared with the steady forward movement of the Moslems during this sultanate, especially on the borders of Antioch. Then came Saladin (1174-93) who almost swept the Latins out of Syria and effectively maintained hisjground against the armies of Europe. Saladin's dominions were divided after his death and his immediate successors made concessions to the Latins for the sake of peace. Even Jerusalem which Saladin had captured was restored (1229-44). The sultans of Egypt, the most power- ful of the Moslem princes, preferred to avoid the risk of a European invasion and were not ambitious of making conquests in Syria. The invasion of the Kharismian Turks, when Jeru- salem was retaken (1244), is a landmark in the history. But r the mamluk sultan Baibars was the first who set himself, and that with brilliant success, to complete Saladin's unfinished task (1260-77). After him Kalawun was less persistent but only his sudden death deprived him of the honour of dealing the last blow at the Latin towns (1279-90). Next year * Akka and the remaining cities on the coast yielded to the troops ofhisson and successor El-malik el-ashraf(1291). The crusading states could not have existed so long without the help which they received from Europe. The support of the west was vital to their very existence. But the prosperity of19\",\"5 HISTORY OF THE LATIN STATES 1 the Syrian colonies was only one matter ofinterest out ofmany to the peoples and rulers ofthe West. When there was a crisis in the history ofthe Syrian states it was not always clear that it possessed a first claim on the attention of Latin Europe. The sending of the first crusade is spoken, of as a challenge of Christendom to Islam, but there was no federated body which could be held responsible for the, defence of the crusading colonies. The amount of help given by the western states depended from time to time on the political condition of Europe and the fluctuating strength of a religious ideal. Soon after the beginning of the 13th century it is clear that a turning point has been reached and that the period of greatest sacrifice and effort in the West is over. Enthusiasm was damped by the practical failure of expeditions for which every possible effort seemed to have been made. Sympathy for the Syrian Latins gave place to alienation. They had acquired something of the character of an eastern people and were tainted besides, just as much as western states, by selfishness and party strife and A secular ambition. century's experience ofhard facts stripped the glamour from the Holy Land and robbed the crusading knights of their early halo. Accordingly as the need of the Latin states increased the help they received grew less. The great crusades of the 12th century were those which followed the downfall of Edessa and the victories of Saladin. But the first was a complete failure (1148-49) and the second only checked Saladin's career without really undoing his work (1189-92). The greatest expedition of the 13th century was at theverycommencement and was directed to the conquest ofthe Byzantine empire (1202-04). The crusades of Frederick II (1228-29)andofTheobald and ofRichard of Cornwall(1239-41) were important because of the concessions which they secured rather than because of their military strength. The invasion of Egypt was twice attempted and both times was an utter failure owing to the ignorance and mismanagement of the leaders (1218-2 1 and 1249-50). In the latter part of the 13th century the only expedition of consequence was the second crusade of Louis IX, which spent its power in Tunis. On the whole it is ; remarkable how little these expeditions accomplished. The20\",\"\\\\ l6 INTRODUCTION : rinain cause oftheir failure seems to havebeentheir international / character and the inevitable dissensions resulting from it. / Christendom was not suflficiently united to accomplish the task I- that was set before it. The internal causes of the overthrow of the Latin states are clear beyond dispute. The comparatively small number of i^ crusaders permanently resident in Syria and the dissensions by which they were rent are the principal factors in the case. The numbers of those who went on crusade to the Holy Land are much exaggerated in the early chronicles. Even of those who actually left home a large number never reached Syria, and of theremainderonly asmall proportion settled in the East. Thus the ordinary population of the Latin states, which always included a considerable alien and Moslem element, was inferior at the best to the opposing forces when these were themselves united. The calamitous effect of the division ofthe Latins into /our princedoms in the I2th century has already been spoken of i In the 13th century the union between the Latin towns was so slight that their prolonged existence depended almost wholly on the favourable character of the external political situation. Even single cities were independent of one another and made war and peace with the Moslems astheypleased. Thestruggles of the Italian republics for supremacy in the Mediterranean introduced fresh elements of discord. The Templars and the Hospitallers, the chief military support of the colonies, were antagonistic to one another. Rival claimants for the kingship of Jerusalem multiplied occasions of civil war and created fresh \\\"^ parties in the state. All these things no doubt fostered selfish- ness and bred indifference to the common cause, just as the commercial instincts of the Italians drew them into alliance Lwith the Moslem sultans. It may thus be argued that moral declension hastened the decay and overthrow ofthe Latinstates. But it is not true that their doom was caused by any extra- ordinary or exceptional corruption. They were probably no worse in character than other peoples of the period. Nor did they manifestly degenerate as time went on. The fatality of their situation was that d]sunion_deliyfired them into the hands ofwatchful enemies.21\",\"7 ITS DIVISION INTO PERIODS 1 In broadest outline the history of the Latin states falls into three periods. There is a period of conquest and of general advance up to 1127 when ZankibecamerulerofMosul aperiod ; of Moslem reaction and triumph under Zanki, Nureddin and Saladin, culminating in the victories of Saladin and the repulse of the \\\" third crusade\\\" and finally a long drawn out period of ; civil wars and petty strife with the Moslems ending in a rapid downfall. The first two periods are the special subject of this essay. Chapters I and II relate the history of the Latin conquest and early advance chapters III, IV and V deal with ; the reigns of Zanki, Nureddin and Saladin respectively, and chapter VI contains a survey of the third period, which almost coincides with the 13th century. s c.22\",\"CHAPTER I.

The situation in Syria at the time of the Latin invasion /-annof wdl hp pvplainp^ withniit sornejreferenre tO tl;e_general condition of the Moslem East Islam was at first a bond of political as well as of religious unity. The caliphs of Mekka succeeded to the secular and spiritual position of the Prophet Mohammed (A.D. 632). But the countries over which they claimed authority were as difficult to unite as Europe itself Natural divisions of land and race favoured separation. The inherent authority of the caliphs was \\\"spiritual\\\" and therefore liable to become that and nothing more. Disputes arose re- garding the legitimate line of succession, and these opened the way for schism. The combined effect is manifest in the time ofthe_Abbasit^ caliphs. They ruled in Bagdad from the year 750 A.D. and were at no time sovereigns of all Islam as their predecessors had been. Within a hundred years their power was in process of decay. Private ambitions and the aspirations of conquered races sheltered themselves behind the claims of the rival line which traced its descent from 'AH. It was in North Africa, about the beginning of the loth century, that a rival caliphate actually established itself, that of the Fatinntes. About 970 A.D. Egypt was conquered by these new caliphs. The greater part of Syria, also, soon passed into their hands, and continued theirs until the Turkish conquest. At the same time the power of the Abbasite caTiphs in Bagdad passed to foreign dynasties, who acknowledged only their spiritual supremacy.23\",\"FIRST CRUSADE 19 In the 11th century the Moslem East was united by another power than that of the caHphs. The first Turkish empire was ^ established by the Seljuk Turks. From 1038 to 1092 they were ruled by three sultans of exceptional ability, who professed Islam, acknowledged the Abbasite caliph, and once more made Bagdad the seat of effective government. Their conquests in some directions exceeded the boundaries of the caliphate which theyprofessed to restore. Theyrecovered Syria almost entirely, although they did not succeed in their attempt on Egypt itself.J But their empire also was fated to dissolution. All depended on the individual ability of the sultan. Even his own emirs recognised his authority only so long as he had strength to compel them. The Turks were a small minority in the lands they ruled, and even the caliph was not always the sultan's friend. When therefore Malik Shah died in 1092 and his death—, was followed by twelve years of almost continuous dynastic strife, the result was inevitable. The Seljuk empire fell to | pieces. In Syria every town of any consequence was free to I go its own way. In Asia Minor the sultanate of Rum entered on a period ofcomplete independence. -'^ It was just at this critical time that the crusaders passed throiJgh_ Asia JMinor into Syria. They had little to fear from the Turkish sultans. Mohammed wa s the son of Malik Shah who ultimately secured the succession, after the death of his brother and rival Bark-yarok in 1104. Hewas a competentruler, but the Latin states were already established and Mohammed never took the field against them in person. After his death in 1118,the sultanate was further divi^ed^ His brotheFSTnjar ruled in the far east until 1157, unconcerned about Syria. At Bagdad Mohammed's sons continued on the throne till 1152.

His policy was to strengthen Egypt internally rather than to extend its conquests in Syria. When he died in 1094 his son Shah-an-shah el-afdal succeeded to his position. It was he who guided the policy of Egypt at the advent of the first crusade. It seems likely that he mistook their intentions for a time. They landed in Asia Minor, and they had come at the request of the Greek emperor to his assistance. They seemed well adapted to weaken the power of the Turks. So far from combining against them, El-afdal was prepared to make alliance with them. He hoped they would be content with their conquests in the north and leave Palestine to Egypt. After news came of the fall of Antioch he captured Jerusalem from its Turkish governor, in the summer of I098^ The crusaders delayed their march to Palestine for several months, and this may have deceived him further. It was not until after the siege and capture of Jerusalem that an Egyptian army entered Palestine to oppose the crusaders. It was surprised and defeated at Ascalon. After this for a few years the port of Jaffa was constantly menaced by the garrison of Ascalon aided by fleets from Eg^pt, but the only occasion on which El-afdal sent a strong army into Syria was in the year 1105. Having again been defeated in this year he made no further serious attempt to invade the country. Even the support which he gave to the Moslem coast-towns was uncertain and ineffective. The prosperity of Egypt was little affected by the presence of the Latins, and the circumstances of its domestic affairs were not favourable to the carrying on of foreign wars. El-afdal died in December 1121 and from that time Egypt was too weak to take the offensive. The establishment of the Seljuk sultanate of Rum has been already alluded to. Its territories, as the name implies, were acquired at the expense of the Roman empire of the East, that is of the Byzantine empire. Previous to the battle of Manzikert, in 1071, the luckless Armenians on the borders of * See Defremcry'sdiscussioninJournal asiatique, 1871, p. 85ff.,decidingagainst theyear 1096given bysomesources.25\",\"FIRST CRUSADE 21 the empire were the principal sufferers at the hands of the advancing Turks. But after that date Asia Minor was rapidly over-run. Within ten years the greater part of it was subdued by the Turks. They established their capital at Nicea, which- was at no great distance from Constantinople itself. It was fear of this new power that drove Alexius to appeal for help to the kings of Western Christendom. The first Moslems witlT whom the crusaders measured arms were the soldiers of Kilij Arslan of Rum (1092-1107). Their success profoundly in- fluenced the position of the Greek empire in Asia Minor. It may be said to have delayed the Turkish invasion of Europe for three centuries and a half. Within a few years of the capture of Nicea, in June 1097, Alexius regained nearly half of Asia Minor. The geographical position of the new Moslem capital, Iconium, marks the difference in the situation. But the sultanate of Rum^pes not play a great part in the history ofthe Latins them^RW The goal of the crusade lay beyond Asia Minojpand the dominions of Kilij Arslan. After the strength ^fthe crusaders had been shown at Doryleum, Kilij Arslan's policy was to see them safely out of his dominions. Their occupation of Syria concerned him little. He was protected from them by the ranges of the Taurus. His attention besides was fully occupied by his contest with the Greeks. In that the Latins took no further share. They regarded the service they had rendered the emperor as merely incidental to the accomplishment oftheir own purposes. The main body of the crusaders did not directly continue their march to Syria after they had passed the territories of Kilij Arslan. At Heraclea, the modern Eregli, they turned sharply north and made a long detour through Armenia Minor. In this district there was no powerful ruler or sovereign to oppose them. Nominallyit was subject to the sultanofBagdad, whoseinterventionwas onlya remote contingency. Thepresence of a large and friendly Armenian population was the cardinal feature of the situation. These Christians had been driven by the Turks from their old homes by sufferings such as again recently have been their lot in Armenia Minor, their new home. They occupied the Taurus ranges and the country to the west26\",\"22 FIRST CRUSADE and east, portions of Cilicia, western Mesopotamia, and Euphra- tepia, or the country between the Euphrates and the Taurus'. The border lands between Asia Minor and Mesopotamia were recent Turkish conquests and imperfectly subdued. Thdre were still towns and castles held by Greek and Armenian governors, and even the beginnings of a new Armenian prince- dom. Without doubt the situation was known from the first to some of the Latin chiefs. The mere presence of the Latin army was sufficient to secure the country. Its march north- wards away from the goal of the crusade is explained by these facts. The assistance rendered to the Armenian towns was amply rewarded. The crusaders found welcome allies and a base of operations against Syria proper. It was in Armenian territory also that the Latins made their fifsTTettiements, and founded their first state, that of Edessa. There was^ar^ectFoTi of IKeCrusaders whicTi crossed directly into Cilicia from Heraclea. It is not Jiftogether certain that this was part ofa concerted plan. Although itwa^tjpth prudent and feasible for a portion of the crusade to occupy Cilicia, private ambitions may have led to the separation. Tancred, it may be, was commissioned by Bohemond to secure the province for the Normans. Baldwin, whether by accident or intention, followed close at his heels and disputed possession with him. At Tarsus where the rivals met there was a bitter quarrel, and at Mamistra there was actual fighting. Finally Baldwin left the Norman in Cilicia\\\" and went to try his fortune in the district of Tell bashir near the Euphrates. He followed * Regardingthiscountryand people, seeEd.

The exile's name was Pakrad (Pancratius), and he and his brother Basil kogh were men of rank and influence in that districts Before beginning his new enterprise Baldwin seems to have waited for the main army of the crusaders'^, which was now advancing across the hills from Caesarea in Cappadocia to Mar'ash. Presumably he wished to consult his brother Godfrey and to strengthen his forces. He separated again from the main body a short distance south of Mar'ash, and whilst they proceeded to the siege of Antioch he began the occupation of Tell bashir (October 1097). His rapid progress in this neighbourhood during the following months was less due to actual conquest than to revolts of the Armenian popu- lation and to treaties with the governors of Armenian towns. Many like Pakrad's brother welcomed the crusader asadeliverer from the Moslem yoke. The inevitable friction between the new settlers and the older inhabitants did not yet much affect the situation^ In the beginning of 1098 the Latins gained a footing on the eastern side of the Euphrates, and the town of ^ Albertiii. 17.

Pakrad (\\\"Pancras\\\") was resident in Kaisun (\\\"Cresson\\\") with Basil in the year iiii when they fought in Tancred's army (Albert xi. 40). He was finally deprived ofhis possessions byBaldwin IIin II 17 (Mt. Ed. i. 117).28\",\"24 FIRST CRUSADE Edessa became their capital. Baldwin was invited there by Thoros, nominally a Greek governor, and by the city council. He was adopted by Thoros and appointed his successor. The proceedings appear to have followed the wish of the citizens more than the choice oftheir ruler. A fortnight later* a popular uprising put Thoros to death and set Baldwin in his place (9th March 1098)^ The Latin prince ruled the province of Edessa until October iioo. He took no direct share in the siege of Antioch. But he sent the besiegers much needed supplies and his presence on the Euphrates was probably a check on some who might have rendered help to the Moslems ofnorthern Syria. From the situation in the countries bordering on Syria we now pass, with the crusaders, to Syria itself There the resistance to the invaders depended mainly on the efforts of the petty rulers or emirs of the principal towns. Some professed allegiance to Bagdad, some to Egypt, none cared much for the fate of any other. The dissensions which arose after the death ofTaj ed-daula Tutush,brother of Malik Shah, in 1095, had not yet subsided^ Tutush had been an aspirant to the sultanate and lost his life in the contest. His sons Rudwan and Dukak each succeeded to a portion of his power. Fakhr el-muluk Rudwan held Aleppo and tried without success to improve his position.

The latter had just made peace with Yagi Siyan and these two now agreed to besiege Homs in alliance. They had scarcely united their forces when news came of the advance of the Latins upon Antioch. To the chagrin of his ally Yagi Siyan hurried backto oppose the invader. Tancred had already passed Iskanderun and pillaged Balana^ which lies at the entrance to the pass leading down to the plains of Antioch. Laodicea was assailed by a pirate fleet which had allied itself with the crusaders in Cilicia^ Where the Armenian population was strong the outlying castles dependent on Antioch were being surrendered.

Fortunately theywere not dependent on themselvesalone. The fleets which occupied Laodicea* and St Simeon secured com- munication with the West and the friendship of the Armenians provided a supply of provisions. But even with this help as winter advanced there was much hardship and suffering in the camp. Famine was only one cause, disease and also inclement weather severely tested the endurance of the besiegers. The issue depended chiefly on the amount of help the Moslem town received. The history of the attempts at relief are of more importance than the details ofthe siege operations. Rudwan was little inclined to help. He was annoyed at the failure of his plan against Homs, and was attracted by the prospect of alliance with El-afdal of Egypt, who was then negotiating with the crusaders. But for this very reason Dukak and Jenah ed-daula were the more ready to give their help.

It encamped before Antioch on the 8th of June^ Had this army arrived a few days sooner the crusades might have been extinguished at their very commencement. Even yet the Latins were in a critical situation. The citadel of Antioch was still uncaptured, so their enemies were before and behind them. Many despaired entirely and fled to the ships on the coast An attempt was made to come to terms with the Moslems. On the other hand Kerboga was disliked and suspected there was discord between the Arab and Turkish ; elements of his army and Rudwan's intrigues are said to have observed, however, that the battle, according to Albert, extends over two days, the 4thand the 5thafterthestart (iii. 51-52). ^ EndofSafar491,ending5thFebruary(Kern.iii.579).

The Latins were greatly encouraged by the finding of the Holy Lance. It was believed to be that used at the Crucifixion, and was regarded as authentic especially by Raymond and the Provencals. Its existence and hiding-place were made known, it is said, by a vision. It was dug up in the Church of St Peter on the 14th of June. On the 28th=' the Latins gallantly made an attack on Kerboga's army. The generalship of Bohemond and the enthusiasm inspired by the Holy Lance, combined with dissension and over-confidence in the Moslem camp, secured a Latin victory. Ruin had stared the Latins in the face, their wonderful success paved the way for all that follows. When the citadel ofAntioch surrendered aweek later^ it was decided to postpone the march on Jerusalem until November. There is no cause for surprise in this. Rest was required after the recent hardships. The season ofthe year was unfavourable. The conditions in Antioch may be judged from the epidemic which raged there for three months, from September to November. It carried off hundreds among the knights alone. But we may credit the leaders with another motive. It was time to decide who should guard and maintain the northern province. Baldwin's position in Edessa was undisputed. But was Antioch to be given to Alexius or left in the hands of Bohemond ? There was reason to suppose that the emperor's action or inaction before the ist of November would clear the way for a decision ofthis embarrassing question. If Alexius had been on the spot it may be assumed that he would have received possession of Antioch and Cilicia. As parts of the empire at a recent date they were to be restored to him, according to agreement, provided he assisted the crusaders in their enterprise. Bohemond's claim was subordinate to this. Before the capture of Antioch he had astutely obtained a provisional acknowledgment of his title, on the assumption that Alexius might not join the Latins or might not give all the help that he had promised*.

IO98 The disputes regarding the lordship of Antioch reached a crisis in November when the march to Jerusalem should have been resumed. No communication had come from the emperor. Bohemond demanded full possession ofthe town, and Raymond _ opposed him. The Lorraine chiefs stood neutral. Time passed and those of the rank and file whose chief object was the delivery ofJerusalem grew restless. Theyhad come for Christ's sake, they said, and would start with him as their leader*. Toward the end of November Bohemond and Raymond came to a partial understanding. They agreed to lay siege to Ma'arat en-nu*man which had been attacked already without success in July'. It is uncertainwhich ofthe other leaders took part in the enterprise ; Robert of Flanders was ^ne*. The movement was probably represented as the beginning of the march on Jerusalem. It is not likely, however, that the agreement between Bohemond and Raymond went so far*.

Regardingthe march to Jerusalem Bohemond argued that it should be postponeduntil after Easter. Raymond hesitated. Then, in response to urgent entreaties, he announced that he would start in fifteen days. The Norman prince mocked at this but had reason to be satisfied. He returned to Antioch. Only Robert of Normandy and Tancred, ofthe other leaders, joined Raymond,inspite ofhis persuasions. The multitude of pilgrims who tore down the walls of Ma'ara when they heard of the proposal to garrison the city and post- pone the march on Jerusalem, did not add greatly to the strength of his army. The town was burned before the Latins started south, on the 13th of January^ From that time Bohe- mond was lord ofAntioch. The slowness of Raymond's march possibly marks the unwillingness withwhich he moved. As he passed up thevalley of the Orontes the towns on the hill slopes and in the plain gladly offered him provisions and money to be left alone. When the crusaders reached the plain beside the Castle of the Kurds, Hisn el-akrad, they halted for fifteen days^ They were greatly impressed by the fertility and abundance ofthe country, the emirs of Horns and Tripolis sent envoys to Raymond and Hisn el-akrad was not the only stronghold which he occupied. Probably in these circumstances he conceived the hope of founding a princedom beyond Bohemond's reach. His next undertaking, the siege of 'Arka, seems to have been inspired, in part at least, by this hope. 'Arka, or 'Irka, lies on the northern slopes of Lebanon some distance down the valley which leads from Homs and Hama to the coast. Raymond's army encamped there on the 14th of February shortly after 3, iii. 519 (14thMuharram592). InKem.iii. 587, 24thMuharramisatextualerrorfor the same date.

This secured communication with crusading fleets and a plentiful supply of provisions. Marakiya, another coast- town, also submitted'. But 'Arka itself remained uncaptured. Godfrey and Robert of Flanders joined Raymond with fresh forces before the middle of March'. Early in February mani- festations of popular impatience had induced them to fix their departure from Antioch for the ist of March. They had marched south by the coast and had begun the siege of Jabala** on the way. But Raymond apprehended attack and urged them to come directly to where he was. The united forces spent two months together in the neighbourhood of *Arka. Raymond's siege operations did not benefit much by their presence. One cause of dissension after another kept the leaders in perpetual antagonism. Shortly before Easter (loth April) ambassadors from Alexius announced that he intended coming to Syria before StJohn's day(24th June) and requested the crusaders to delay their march on Jerusalem until that date. Raymond eagerlyadvocated this proposal, which suited his own plans and would certainly have imperilled Bohemond's position in Antioch. But the other leaders put no trust in the emperor's promises and a policy of further delay was unpopular amongst Raymond's own followers. It was decided to march on Jeru- salem whatever course of action he might choose to follow. When the army started on the 13th of May* Raymond followed most unwillingly. He had gained nothing by all his schemes and efforts. Antartus and his other captures were not main- tained. ' Gesta Francorum, ch. 34,givesparticulars.

No time was spent in operations on the road, nor was any opposition offered by the cities on the coast. The dangerous hill paths south of Tripolis and the pass by the Dog River were un- obstructed. The crusaders gazed with interest on the \\\"ancient walls\\\" of the Phoenician towns. The learned among them speculated as to what each city was and sought to identify its name and history. In Palestine the line of march led the pilgrims close to the walls of *Akka, Haifa, Caesarea and Arsuf in succession, A short distance inland, on thewayto Jerusalem, the little town of Ramla was found to be deserted, and became A the first Latin possession in southern Syria. bishopric was established in honour of St George and a small garrison was left in the town. On the morning of the 7th of June (1099)^ the crusaders reached the holy city. The Egyptian garrison may be estimated roundly at locx) men, and the whole fighting population of the city cannot have exceeded a few thousands^ Provided that neither the Egyptians nor the neighbouring Moslems interfered, the success of the Latins was assured from the first. Their numbers have been estimated at about 40,000, ofwhom perhaps 20,000 were fighting men^ The siege lasted five weeks, but most of that time was occupied in the preparation of siege engines. The crusaders pitched their tents opposite those parts of the town where the wall appeared to be most vulnerable.

After the failure of an assault on the 13th of June* it was decided to proceed at once with the construction of siege towers and mangonels. A native Christian informed the leaders where wood might be procured, about four miles away. The .Moslems of the neighbouring villages were compelled to assist in bringing timber to the camp. The arrival of a small Genoese fleet in Jaffa about the 17th of June* was specially welcome because of the supply of provisions which it brought. The Genoese abandoned their ships and joined Raymond on the south side of the city. The besiegers suffered greatly from want of water, the springs in the neighbourhood having been filled up and the cisterns emptied. Two siege towers and a number of siege engines were completed by the end of the first week of July. On Friday the 8th there was a procession round the town. The following days were spent in moving the engines and towers into position and in filling up a moat on the south side. Wednesday the 1 3th was the first day of the renewed assault', and on Friday the 15th Godfrey's troops successfully scaled the wall at the north-east corner.

The bishops and clergy were against the proposal. \\\" A king,\\\" they said, \\\"should not be chosen where God suffered and was crowned^\\\" In spite of their opposition one of the earliest decisions after Jerusalem was captured was to elect a prince. Raymond of Toulouse was the first choice made. But he shared the views of the clergy and refused the position-. Then Godfrey was chosen'. In most of the earliest writers his designation is Dux or Defender of the^Holy^Sepjalchre. These titles express the attitude of the church party to his position. An illustration ofthe same attitude may be found in Raymond's attempts to keep possession ofthe tower of David and to secure Ascalon for himself. But Godfrey was determined to be prince in fact, whatever his title might be. He wielded the authority ofa king and his successor was crowned as such. Neither the capture of Jerusalem nor the battle of Ascalon completed the work of the first crusade. Most, indeed, of the crusaders returned homewithout lendingtheir assistance further. They had endured hardships enough, they had delivered Jerusalem and fulfilled their vows. Many sailed for Europe that very autumn, others only awaited the Easter celebrations before they returned. If it be said that the crusade was ended the Latin tenure of Jerusalem was much too precarious to justify the boast that the crusaders' purpose had been accomplished. Palestine at least was yet to be conquered. There is no break in the continuity of events between the ending of the crusade and the further history of the crusaders in the east. The work of conquest proceeds without interruption. The \\\"exiles\\\" in Palestine laboured still in the cause which their former comrades now relinquished. The conquest of Palestine proper* was an undertaking of less extent than a survey of the map might lead one to suppose. * Agiles,ch. 35.

II.41\",\"A.D. 1099 GODFREY 37 The real contest lay with the coast-towns. Inland the most populous centres were mere villages and the sparse country population either took refuge in Egypt or readily submitted to the new lords of the little country towns. It mattered little to the Syrian peasant of what nationality his master was, Turkish or Egyptian or Latin as the case might be. The feudal system of the Latins easily adapted itself to the land tenure of the country. The revenues of the districts assigned to the vassals of the crown or to the sub-vassals of the great feudatories, such as Tancred of Tiberias, were easily collected from the heads of the villages or casalia which covered the country with a perfect net-work. Whenever the Latins established themselves in such centres as Jaffa or Jerusalem or Tiberias the population of the surrounding country submitted to them as a matter of course. The friendly relations of the native Christians and Moslems, established by long association, remained undisturbed, with the difference that the Christians for a time were the principal medium in the development of friendly intercourse with the new rulers. Zahir ed-din Tugtakin of Damascus (1098-1128) might have made the Latin occupation of northern Palestine insecure. But his outlook and activity were more in the direction of Tripolis, and for several years he seems to have refrained as far as possible from active hostilities. His only collision was with Tancred of Tiberias when that chief claimed the revenues of some districts beyond Jordan which were tributary to Damascus. The real task which the Latins had to face was the conquest of the towns on the coast. Until these were subdued even the occupation of the interior was precarious and the lines of communication with Europe unsafe. In southern Syria they were theonlywealthy and important towns excepting Jerusalem and Damascus. But their strength from a military point of view was much weakened by their political isolation. Each town depended for its defence almost entirely upon its own inhabitants, and the military element, especially in the larger towns,wasnodoubtsmall compared withthe civilian population. It is clear from the subsequent historythat the fate ofthecoast- towns was decided in the last resort in every case by the naval42\",\"38 KINGDOM OF JERUSALEM : A.D. IO99 ' superiority of the Latins. As long as Egyptian ships had free access to their harbours the towns were safe. On the other hand their capture was easily effected when the command ofthe sea was held by an Italian fleet. The Egyptian fleets hardly ever fought a naval battle and altogether played avery timorous part in the struggle. On the other hand the Italian states sent fleets to Palestine which eagerly off^ered their services to the Latin princes. They had played a part in the first crusade during the operations against Antioch, 'Arka and Jerusalem. After the fall of Jerusalem they came again, conveying bands of pilgrims from Europe. At once they saw their opportunity. When the Syrian coast towns were conquered they could establish markets there and import their merchandise free of duty. To these Italians the new colonies were the doors of commercial intercourse between east and west. The Italian fleets were the decisive factor in the conquest of Latin Syria. The republics which equipped them and sent them forth were rewarded by the grant ofa special quarter in such towns as they assisted in capturing. A large and wealthy Italian population soon controlled a great part of the revenues of the coast towns and the surrounding districts and enjoyed asystemofcommunal government,much to the advantageoftheirtradeandcommerce. The one disadvantage oftheir presencewas that theyintroduced another line of cleavage into an already much divided state. But the evil consequences of this are scarcely apparent for a century or more and at the outset the co-operation of the Italians was an essential condition of the success of the Latin enterprise. During the earliest years of the Latin occupation the only formidable Moslem attacks were those of the Egyptian troops whose headquarters were at Ascalon. Unlike Damascus Egypt had considerable reason to resist the Latin invaders. Some of the coast towns were still its dependencies and all Palestine had recently seemed just within its grasp. But El-afdal's policy was weak. After his defeat at Ascalon in 1099 ^»s Syrian expeditions have no other apparent object than the capture of Jaft\\\"a and incidentally of Ramla. The forces which he sent to Palestine could not be expected to fight successful43\",\"A.D. 1099 GODFREY 39 battles with the army of Jerusalem, or at least were much inferior to what might have been sent into the field for this purpose. Their numbers are much exaggerated by the Latin chroniclers. They do not ever appear to have exceeded 10,000 men and usually they may be estimated at from three to five thousand. The Latins with an army halfthat sizewon victories year after year in virtue of superior fighting qualities and better tactics. Their numbers increased until they were a match for the strongest army that the Egyptians could produce. The expeditions from Ascalon became mere garrison raids and El-afdal's opportunity passed completely away. Had he used his numerical advantage to the full when the Latin armies numbered only two or three thousand men the course of the Latin conquest of Syria would not have run so smoothly. In the autumn of 1099 the army which remained with Godfrey for the defence of the Holy Sepulchre and the com- pletion ofthe work ofthe first crusade didnotexceed3000men\\\\ When this became obvious,the emirs ofthecoasttowns,whohad hitherto anxiously avoided conflict with the crusaders, began to recover confidence. Arsuf lay nearest to the Latin settlements and was the first to challenge its new neighbours to a trial of strength. Godfrey besieged the town for 7 weeks, from the end of October to the middle of December^. His failure was due principally to the want of a fleets At Christmas Bohemond of Antioch and Baldwin of Edessa visited Jerusalem in company A with archbishop Daimbert (Dagobert) of Pisa. large Pisan fleet with the archbishop on board had landed in Laodicea three months before.

HOC February and March there were skirmishes with the troops of Arsufsupported by horsemen from Ascalon and Arabs from the south of Palestine'. The garrison of Ramla, which numbered lOO knights and 200 foot-soldiers', was active on the Latin side. It may be supposed that the visit of the knights of Antioch and Edessa and especially the arrival of the Pisan fleet convinced the Moslems that the Latin power was not to be estimated merely by the strength of Godfrey's army. At all events about Easter (i100) first the emir of Arsufand then those ofAscalon, Caesarea and 'Akka offered tribute in return for a period of truce'. Their proposals were accepted and turned out much to the advantage of the Latins. After Easter there was a perfect exodus of crusaders from the country, and many of those who remained were induced to do so with the greatest difficulty*. During the summer pestilence broke out, owing, it is said, to the number of unburied bodies which polluted the country. There was a general failure of the Syrian crops, also, and therefore a great scarcity of food. Many of the natives went down to Egypt in consequence of the pestilence and fami^e^ The Latins found welcome markets in the Moslem towns with which they had peace and received large supplies especially from Ascalon.

The Latin army in the former case included 200 knights and a 1000 foot-soldiers, and its rear- guard was attacked on the way home by some hundreds of horsemen from Damascus. The main purpose and effect of the expeditions was to secure that the revenues of the district should be paid to Tancred.

After it had been decided to attack 'Akka and whilst the land forces under the command of Tancred were on the march, Godfrey died (i8th July iioo)*. The Venetian fleet was still in the port of 'AkkaMw'At Tancred's suggestion it sailed for Haifa a few days laterI Within a month this town was captured', after a vigorous attack in which the besiegers employed seven mangonels and a large moveable tower. On the day of the capture the garrison and the inhabitants were invited to gather round a cross, as to a place of safety, and were then pitilessly massacred without regard to age or sex. The Venetians resigned their share of the spoil to the Syrian Latins and sailed home without further delay, in order to escape the storms of winter. Godfrey'sdeath at once re-opened the constitutional question which had been so warmly discussed in July of the previous year. When Daimbert was elected patriarch both Godfrey and Bohemond had accepted from him a formal title to their lands. Even in Godfrey's lifetime the patriarch claimed that this act, done \\\"for the loveof God*,\\\" was an acknowledgment of his supreme authority in Jerusalem. He now sought to establish his claim and appealed to the Norman chiefs for help. Godfrey had named his brother Baldwin of Edessa as one well fitted to succeed him. The nomination satisfied most of the southern Latins but was distasteful toTancred aswell as to the patriarch. It is unlikely that Bohemond, in any circumstances, would have ' The most exact account of these events is given bythe Translatio Nicolai; in Albert vii. 20ff. there are a number of errors and inconsistencies.

He would rather have attempted to add Jerusalem to his own possessions and to unite all Syria under himself. But just at the crisis and before the news of Godfrey's death had reached him he was captured by the Moslems\\\\ Baldwin, accordingly, when he reached Jerusalem in the second week of November^, had no great difficulty in bearing down all opposition. In the following March (noi) Tancred relinquished Tiberias and went north to A take Bohemond's place in Antioch. few months later Daimbert was deposed and Baldwin's authority was no longer seriously questioned^ The later patriarchs, especially Baldwin's friendArnulf(i11i-i118),altogetherabandoned theclaim which Daimbert had sought to establish. The Latins could have had no more competent leader in their early Moslem wars than Baldwin I. His invariable policy was one ofaggression and bold attack. A serious enemy rarely got within striking distance of any Latin town without first measuring arms with Baldwin. He wore out the spirit of the garrison of Ascalon by his constant readiness, and only once suffered a reverse at their hands. On the Damascus border he was equally vigilant. From the year 1105 Tugtakin of Damascus co-operated more actively with the Egyptians and with the Syrian coast towns. But Baldwin's own army, ex- clusive of western reinforcements, might now be reckoned at from five to six thousand foot-soldiers, and such a force was more than a match for the armies of the enemy. The out- standing features of the first portion of his reign (1100-1108), more particularly, have just been described, those characteristic ofthe latter portion (i109-1118) receive comment later on. Baldwin's first enterprise as Godfrey's successor is character- istic of the spirit by which he was animated and its purpose may be inferred from the impression which it could not fail to produce on friend and foe alike. A week after his arrival he left Jerusalem with 150 knights and 503 foot-soldiers. He 1 Chap. II, p. 73. 2 AboutMartinmas(Albertvii. 37).

IIOI encamped for a few days beside Ascalon and skirmished with its garrison. Next he punished some Arab tribes which had been making the roads unsafe for pilgrims. Afterwards he raided somedistrictsbeyond the Dead Seaand when he returned to Jerusalem he had been absent altogether for 4 weeks*. On Christmas day he was crowned by the patriarch at Bethlehem as the first of the Latin kings. In the spring of iioi a Genoese fleet which had wintered in I ' Laodicea arrived in Jaffa. After Easter its help secured the capture of Arsuf and Caesarea. The former capitulated within three days and its inhabitants were permitted to withdraw to Ascalon. The latter was stormed after a fortnight's resistance and a large part of the adult male population was put to the sword (May iioi)^. In both cases the Genoese fleet received one-third of the spoils and had a special quarter of the town assigned to them. Alarmed by these events El-afdal of Egypt strongly reinforced the garrison ofAscalon (beginning ofJuly)^ and sought an alliance with Tugtakin of Damascus. In the beginning of September the Egyptians were on the point of moving, probably against Jaffa, without Tugtakin's assistance. Within 3 days of the time when Baldwin heard of their intention he had assembled a force of from 12-1300 men*, had 1 Fulcherii. 3and 4; Albert vii. 38-43. * Fulcher ii. 7-8 gives particulars.

The issue of the battle was decided within an hour from its commencement by the advanceofthe rear divisions under Baldwin's own command.

His purpose was to protect the pilgrims who had escaped from Asia Minor^ and were now on their way to celebrate Easter in Jerusalem®.

Baldwin hurried to the rescue with a small forced which the enemy quickly surrounded and overpowered (27th May)l Some fled to Ramla, others to Jaffa, Baldwin himself escaped to Arsuf.

IIO5-06 The Latins gained a decisive but hard-won victory. The Moslems on the fleet outside Jaffa were informed of the result by the head of the emir of Ascalon being thrown on board one of their ships. On the voyage home, after a visit paid to Tyre and Sidon, they also met with disaster, for 25 of the ships were wrecked in a storm. Tugtakin's share in the invasion of this year is noteworthy. It seems to have been the course of domestic affairs which at length involved him in war with the Latins. In June 1104 Dukak ofDamascusdied. Tugtakin then governed in the name of his son, being in fact absolute ruler. Baktash, a brother of Dukak\\\\ claimed to be his successor and established himself in the Hauran. He negotiated with Baldwin and actually fought as an ally ofthe Latins against Egypt in 1 105'. This no doubt explains the co-operation of troops from Damascus on the other side. It wasTugtakin'sfirstactofaggression and thecommence- ment ofhostilities which continued for some years (i105-08). In the spring of 1 106 Baldwin's troops destroyed the crops and laid waste the country round Ascalon. In the summer preparations were made for besieging Sidon. The arrival of 7000 pilgrims, chiefly English, emboldened the Latins to the undertaking. While the king was making ready news came to him of the death of Hugh of Tiberias. The Sidonians had already offered him a sum of money to abstain from his attack and this henow resolved to accept. He had been inclined todo so previously, for he was much in need of money. The pilgrims were informed of the situation and returned home. Baldwin A hastened to Tiberiasl Latin castle in the district of Suwad, in the Hauran, had been causing the Moslems of Damascus much annoyance. Tugtakin was on an expedition against it when he encountered Hugh of Tiberias. The Latins were defeated, Hugh slain and the castle destroyed*.

Hewas recalled by the news ofadangerous raid from Ascalon, in the second week of October. A company of incautious pilgrims had been surprised near Ramla, the garrison ofJaffa had been repulsed, and Castle Arnolf had been attacked and surrendered. After the arrival of the king in the neighbourhood of Ascalon there was no further movement on either side^ Tugtakin now anticipated that he would be attacked, and from the commencement of 1107, or even earlier, was encamped inthe district of Suwad, readyto meet invasion^ Baldwin'sonly aggressive movement however was against a Moslem castle to the east of the Dead Sea. The castle had been recently built and was deserted by its garrison upon Baldwin's approach. This was in the second week of MarchI The expedition went by the south of the Dead Sea and returned by the north. Baldwin, for his part,was apprehensive ofattack from Tugtakin. For this reason he was in Tiberias for a short time in the early days ofJanuaryand again after Easter^ On thesecond occasion news that the governor of Tyre threatened the Latin fortress of Tibnin^ was the probable cause of his leaving for 'Akka**. No particulars ofwhat occurred are known. Shortly afterwards the itwasnotmuchbeforeOctober. As I.A. i. 229 gives October-November 1105 and Sibtiii. 530 February-March 1106 there is a considerable element ofuncertaintyin the matter. Albert differs from the representation of the text, which follows the Arabic sources, in making Hugh's defeat take place near Banyas while he was returning from an expedition into the Suwad. It is to be noted that the Arabic writers do not mention Hugh's name. Sibt calls the castle 'Ad(?). ^ Albert x. 8-16.

It is said that there were troops from Damascus co-operating with them*. Seventy-five men fromJaffa fought a successful skirmish with a superior number ofMoslems in November*. In 1 108, possibly in June or July, Baldwin appeared with an army before Tyre. He remained in the neighbourhood during four weeks. He was chiefly occupied in building a castle which was intended, no doubt, to be a protection against such expedi- tions as that which had been made from the town in the previous year. After receiving a payment of7000 pieces ofgold from the governor the king withdrew his forces^ In August he laid siege to Sidon. The city walls and two towers were severely injured by the bombardment of the Latin engines. But before the besiegers had pressed their advantage ships from Egypt and from Tripolis defeated and drove away Baldwin's fleet. A vigorous sally from the town next day showed how the Moslems were encouraged. News came that Tugtakin was advancing to relieve the town. Baldwin burned his engines and marched off on the following day^ It was after this, according to Arabic testimony^ that Gervase ofTiberias was defeated bytroops from Damascus. The Latin force was cut to pieces and its leader captured^ Following this Baldwin and Tugtakin made peace. They agreed to observe a four years' truce' and to partition the revenues of the territories in dispute, Suwad and Jebel 'auf\\\".

Tripolis^ From the year 1109 the policyofJerusalem beginsto be affected by the course of events in northern Syria. Both a cause and a symptom of the change is the establishment of a new relation between Tripolis and Jerusalem. Before relating the events of 1109 it is desirable to sketch the historyofTripolis up to this point. The early history of Latin Tripolis gives it a certain claim to separate mention in the list of Latin states. But previous to 1109 it was merely a state in embryo. Tripolis, its capital,- was still in Moslem hands and the Latin towns were few and com- paratively insignificant. The conquest ofthe district was at last effected by the help of Baldwin of Jerusalem and others of the neighbouring Latins. As a consequence Tripolis became a dependency of Jerusalem. The first counts of Tripolis, in fact, were not strong enough to create a separate princedom andtheir successors for many years were vassals ofJerusalem. Raymond of Toulouse had he lived a few years longer might, indeed, have been successful in creating an independent state. But such compensation for his misfortunes during the first crusade was snatched from him by his early death. His history after the battle of Ascalon (August 1099) is shortly told. Without much delay he returned to northern Syria. He found Bohemond attempting to capture Laodicea from the Greeks, and frustrated the attempt by his interference. He remained in the town some months, until his departure to Constantinople in the beginning of Ilool He took part in one of the unsuccessful crusades of the year iioi^ and returned to Syria in the beginning of 1102. The three remaining years ofhis life werespent intheendeavour to make conquests in the neighbourhood ofTripolis. It has alreadybeen observed that the territories ofDamascus ^ I.A. i. 270 states that after Tugtakin was defeated in Tripolis, next year, he receivedassurancesfrom BaldwinthatthepeacewithJerusalem remained unaffected. 2 Albertvi. 55-60. AccordingtoFulcheri. 22 Raymondwasstillin Laodiceaat the beginning of 1100.

According to Caffarus xviii. 45 Marakiya was Greek about the date of the capture of Antioch, whereas Balanyas was Moslem. ^ Seechap. II,p. 75. 4—256\",\"5^ COUNTY OF TRIPOLIS A.D. IO99-1105 were in closer touch with the county of Tripolis than with the kingdom of Jerusalem. Tugtakin aimed persistently at the conquest of Homs and Hama, and these towns were the near neighbours of Tripolis. The valley of the Bika', between the ranges of Lebanon and Anti-lebanon, may be said to have lain within the territory of Damascus, and after the death of Jenah ed-daula of Homs, in May 1103, Homs itself was a dependency. When Baldwin was on his way south to become Godfrey's successor (October iicx)) the Moslem forces which obstructed his passage through the pass north of the Dog River (Nahr el-kelb) were chiefly from Homs and Damascus^ Tugtakin also gave some help to the Moslems of Tripolis, during their nine years struggle with the Latins. At the same time thehills of Lebanon and the Jebel Ansariya form a natural boundary to the west of which the Latins might establish themselves without causing much concern to the rulers of Damascus. Damascus always faced towards Aleppo, and whatever question might complicate the problems ofSyrian politics its firstconcernwas to strengthen its position and to expand its territories in that direction. When Homs and Hama were tributary it still looked northwards and not to the coast of Tripolis. The Latins deprived Damascus of no territory which it coveted or possessed so long as they remained within the shelter ofthe hills which divided them from the central plains of Syria. Raymond might in fact establish himself in Tripolis without encountering much opposition from Tugtakin. The measure of his success would be the measure of his superiorityover the local emirs. With\\\"marvellousaudacity\\\" he sought to conquer Tripolis with a force of some 4CX> men^ His chief gains were made with the help of two Italian fleets. Aided by them and by western pilgrims he secured a footing in the county from which he could not easily be dislodged. The emir ofTripolis remained safe within the walls ofhis capital but was no match elsewhere for Raymond's activity and boldness. The friendship between Raymond and Alexius gave the latter an ally against the Normans in Antioch and the former indis- * Full particulars are given byFulcher ii. i-a and Albert vii. 33-35.

In February 1105, when Raymond died, the princedom which had so often escaped him seemed at length to bejust within his grasp. When Raymond began operations in 1102 he was assisted by the crusaders who had survived the disasters of the previous year in Asia Minor and by a Genoese fleet which came north- wards after having paid a short visit to Jerusalem. Antartus yielded to the Latin forces, with little or no resistance, and was left \\\"by common consent\\\" in Raymond's hands (March 1102)^ He had a claim to this town dating from the time of the first crusaded Fakhr el-mulk, emir of Tripolis, seeing the Latins within easy reach of his very gates, now sent for help to Homs and Damascus. A united Moslem force, under Jenah ed-daula of Homs, invested Antartus in the following month, but only for a few days, at the end of which the Moslems were surprised in their camp, and driven away (April 1102)^ Raymond in his 1 Albert viii. 42 and Anna 66f.

Fulcherii. 17). Thismakes the capture of Antartus about the middle of March. The date of the Chron. Maxentii 241 is accordingly a month too late (xii Kal. Mali=20th April). Hagen- meyer, Chronologicx.403ff., acceptsBamberger'scorrection of theChron.Maxentii into xii Kal. Martii (i8th February) andargues against thereadingMartioinchoante in Albert viii. 41.

If soitisremarkable that Albert, so far from suggesting this, almostexcludes it bythewayinwhich he relates the matter. When Fulcher ii. 16 saysthatthepilgrimsexpected Raymondto accompanythem to Jerusalem he is not necessarily in conflict with Albert's statement that the city was given to Raymond excommuniconsilio.

I.A.i. 211f. narrates the same events as happening previous to thesiegeof Antartus and locates the battle outside Tripolis (towhich the Moslems retreatedaccordingto Caffarus).

He com- municated his plan to Alexius and afterwards, probably in 1103, received from Cyprus the men and material he required for its construction*. An attempt of Raymond's to relieve the town of Laodicea,which Tancred was besieging,falls in the latter part of 1102 or the beginning of 1103^ In the spring of 1103 the castle of Tuban was attacked and immediatelyafterwards Hisn el-akrad was invested (April)*. On the 1st of May of this year Jenah ed-daula of Homs was assassinated^ When Raymond heard the news at Hisn el-akrad he immediately presented himself before the city, and the in- habitants were compelled to buy his retreat by the payment of a sum of money.

In the spring of 1104 a Genoese fleet of 40 galleys assisted Raymond to capture Jubail, which lies a short distance south of Tripolis on the wayto Beirut^ The Genoese received one-third of the town as their reward. The same fleet immediately after- wards assisted Baldwin at the siege of 'Akka, and Raymond accompanied them there. It may be supposed that during the summer and autumn he co-operated with the Greeks in their campaign against Antioch^ and thereby also strengthened his own position on the coast. In February 1105, during a Moslem attack onthehousesatthefootofthe Pilgrims' hill, Raymondwas injured by the fall of a burning house, and died 10 days later (28th February 1105)^ During the first crusade he was over- matched by his rival Bohemond and he never gained in Syria the position which his wealth and ability might have been expected to secure for him. But he was one of the first men of rank and influence to pledge himselfto be a crusader, and byhis prompt adhesion he doubtless contributed greatly to the success ofthe movement in Europe. In 1 105 Rudwan of Aleppo, Tugtakin of Damascus, and Sukman of Maridin, all appeartohavecontemplated expeditions against the Latins of Tripolis. Most probably the death of Raymond roused their hopes.

Scarcely any par- ticulars are known ofthe petty warfare which he waged with his Moslem neighbours from 1105 to 1109. Tripolis suffered most. Its trade was ruined and supplies of food for the city were obtained with difficulty. Mention is once made of its receiving provisions from the Greeks of Laodicean Fakhr el-mulk appealed in vain for help to the sultan and to the Moslems of Syria. In 1108 he left the town in charge of a cousin and in Bagdad and elsewhere described the extremities towhich hewas reduced and the danger of the situation in Syria. Even this effort to rouse interest and gain support had no practical result. The sultan and theemirsof Mesopotamiawerejust thenengaged in serious conflicts of their own». Meantime the inhabitants of Tripolis placed themselves undertheprotection of Egypt. Fakhr el-mulk's officers were arrested and sent to Egypt. When he himselfreturned in themiddleofAugusthetook uphisresidence in Jabala*. About this same time' the governor of 'Arka trans- ferred his allegiance to Tugtakin of Damascus. Tugtakin sent troops to occupy the town, and afterwards, in the beginning of 1109, followed in person with 4000 horsemen under his command. He was attacked by the Latins near *Arka. His troops were seized with panic, and he saved himself only by headlong flight (early in March 1109). After this William Jordan laid siege to 'Arka, and so completely cut off supplies that in three weeks time its defenders made their escape to the hills and left the town unoccupied for the Latins to take possession (beginning of April 1109)\\\". * Regarding Suktnan, see I.A. i. ai6f.

The capture was effected by a combined attack in which all the Latin states took part. The year is made notable by this union of forces and by the circumstances which led to it. Sometime in March\\\\ Bertram, a son of Raymond of Toulouse, appeared in Syria. He came from France to claim his father's inheritance. His claim was disputed by William Jordan, who received assurance ofsupport from Tancred. On the other hand Bertram was promised help by Baldwin of Jerusalem. Bertram had withhim aconsiderableforceofshipsandmenand vigorously began the siege of Tripolis^. He was joined in three weeks by Baldwin of Jerusalem with about 1000 men. Tancred and Baldwin of Edessa arrived soon afterwards to discuss the situation, at the invitation of Baldwin of Jerusalem. Bertram and William were reconciled in accordance with an agreement by which the former was acknowledged to be his father's heir, while the latter was confirmed in the possession of 'Arka and other conquests he had made^ The mediators were notwithout their reward, Bertram became Baldwin's vassal and William swore allegiance to Tancred''. After this the siege of Tripolis was pressed forward and the citysurrendered on the 12thofJuly 1109^ Reliefwas on the way from Egypt, but too late. Shortly after these events William Jordan was assassinated by one of his attendants\\\". His removal no doubt secured more completely Bertram's position, as defined bythe recent compact. But Tancred seems to have gained most of the advantage. I.A.i.270saysTugtakincapturedthecastleofEl-kamabeforehisdefeat.

I IO9-IO Even Antartus, to which Bertram had a good claim, was seized by Tanc^ed^ 'Arka, however, passed into the hands ofBertram. The attack on the Moslems of the neighbourhood during the following year was chiefly Tancred's work^ But one movement may be attributed to Bertram. In A.H. 503, and so probably before the end of A.D. 1109, Rafaniya was threatened by the Latins. Tugtakin assembled his forces for its protection and finally a treaty was made by which the Latins received the fortresses of Munaitera and 'Akkar and in addition the revenues of other districts^ Tugtakin was now seriously alarmed at the course of events. That winter he thought of accompanying Fakhr el-mulk to Bagdad to explain the state of affairs again to the sultan. In the beginning of 1 1 10, however, he laid siege to Ba'albek, the governor ofwhich he suspected ofnegotiating with the Latins. The town was captured in Ramadan (ends 22nd April) and handed overto Taj el-muluk Buri, ason ofTugtakin^ By this time it was evident that Bertram wasengaged elsewhere. Without attempting further to extend his borders he devoted himself, as a vassal of the kingdom of Jerusalem, to the further- ance of Baldwin's schemes. For 70 years the history of the county of Tripolis is almost merged in that of the kingdom of Jerusalem. One narrative suffices for both. There could be no uncertainty regarding Baldwin's best policy in the year 1110. The Moslem towns of Tyre, Sidon and Beirut commanded the coast from the borders of Palestine to the borders of Tripolis and made communications with the north by sea and land equally unsafe. The towns on the coast of Palestine had been subdued, excepting Ascalon, and Sidon had already been besieged. The current peace with Damascus and the practical annexation of Tripolis in 1 109 were important factors in the situation. But Baldwin's capture of Beirut and Sidon in one year (mo) is more than a testimony to the soundness of his judgment, it was the result and evidence of mo* remarkable energy and personal effort.

An adjacent pine forest supplied timber for the siege towers and mangonels. Relief ships from Tyre and Sidon left the town to its fate when they found how strictly the harbour was guarded. On Friday the 13th of MayS in the iith week of the siege, the Latins stormed the town. Some ofthe inhabitants escaped in ships to Cyprus but many were massacred before effective orders were given that the survivors should be spared Before the capture of Beirut news reached Baldwin that Edessa was besieged and in great peril. Joscelin of Tell bashir was the messenger. Perhapstheco-operation ofthe Latins at the siege of Tripolis last year suggested their common action now. Besides Baldwin understood the situation of Edessa; he had founded the state himself and realised the nature of its needs. In the beginning of June, after a short visit to Jerusalem, he set out to the assistance ofhis nephew Baldwin. Theparticulars of the expedition belong to the history of the north ; here it need only be said that its main purpose was achieved and the reliefof Edessa effected^ This expedition occupied Baldwin three months or more. In August, during his absence, an Egyptian fleet threatened both Beirut and 'Akka and 500 horsemen started from Ascalon, with the intention, it was supposed, of surprising Jerusalem, only however to be themselves surprised and defeated\\\"*. When Baldwin returned home he found that a large Norwegian fleet had arrived in Palestine. It was decided to make an attack on Sidon at once with the help of so important an ally. The besiegers were also joined by a Venetian fleet^ After a siege ^ Fulcherii. 40 (wherehisdeciesin Migneshould be bis decies); Ibn ICh.iii. 456 (Friday, 21st Shawal 503).

Theterms weregrantedand observed. About SOOO of the inhabitants availed themselves of the permission to leave the city. Two notable captures had been made in the year which now closed. Only Tyre ofthe old Phoenician coast- towns remained in Moslem hands. In the early part of nil there was a threat of renewed war between Damascus and Jerusalem. Baldwin lay at Tiberias with the intention of invading the territory of Tugtakin, and Tugtakin took up his position at Ras el-ma ready to meet the invader. The cause of these movements is not certain. The truce of 1108, if it was for four years, had not yet expired. But no military engagement took place. The truce was renewed on terms more advantageous to Baldwin than previously'. Tugta- kin'sinterestcontinued to lie more in the north than in the south. In the summer Baldwin's attention was devoted to the posi- tion of affairs in Ascalon. There seemed to be an opportunity of gaining that city. The governor was disaffected to Egypt and opened correspondence with Baldwin. Finally he declared his independence and strengthened his position by enrolling Armenian troops in his service. Shortly after this, however, he was assassinated (beginning of July) and an Egyptian governor resumed control of the town*. Baldwin would fain have inter- fered but was powerless from the outside. * 3rd Rabi' ii 504 (I.A. i. 175).

IIII-I2 BALDWIN I 6l Still in the same year, 1111, Baldwin's assistance was claimed and given a second time to the Latins of the north. Maudud of Mosul, the besieger of Edessa in mo, this year invested Joscelin in Tell bashir. Afterwards a portion of his army entered the territory ofAleppo and threatened the dependencies ofAntioch. It was nowthat Baldwin joined Tancred (beginning of September)\\\\ Tugtakin was in the opposite camp with Maudud. There was no seriousengagement,buttheco-operation of Baldwin's forces made the Latin army amply sufficient to keep the enemy in check2. Even yet king Baldwin's display of energy and perseverance this year was not exhausted. After his return from the north he prepared for the siege ofTyre. The Greek emperor promised to send a fleet. On the other side the Tyrians were warned of their danger and obtained reinforcements from Tugtakin. The town was invested on the 30th of November^, St Andrew's day. The blockade was weak because the Greek ships failed to appear. The principal effort to capture the city was made in the following spring (1112). Two lofty siege towers were constructed and advanced against the walls (March). But the courage and skill of the defenders were equal to the needs of their situation. One of the towers was speedily set on fire and completely destroyed. About a month later the second shared its fate. The townsmen were so encouraged by this success that they sallied out and now destroyed a number of the besiegers' engines. This was a final blow to the Latins, who were com- pletelydispirited and withdrewtheir forces on the lothofApril*. ^ See chap. II, p. 93. It is rather surprising that Baldwin did not go north sooner.

III2-I3 Tugtakin's proximity had probably influenced their decision to retreat. During the siege he captured the Latin castle of Hubais or Habis\\\\ and latterly he had made his presence felt in the neighbourhood of Tyre. The failure of the Latins was more than a temporary repulse. They were discouraged and exhausted by the results of the siege. After Easter Baldwin plundered a caravan as it passed by the south of the Dead Sea. Two hundred horsemen accompanied him and rich booty was made. But this was the only enterprise ofthe year 1 1 12'. In the spring of 1113 Baldwin and 300 knights went to escort a company of 500 pilgrims past the neighbourhood of 1 Tyre. Five hundred Moslems sallied from the city and were repulsed,but the pilgrims turned back to'Akka because ofnews of further danger'. In the beginning of May Maudud ofMosul crossed the Euphrates* in the direction of Syria. It seems that Baldwin received word from Edessa that an attack on himself in southern Syria was intended\\\". At all events in the beginning of June he took the aggressive against the territories of Damascus by an expedition into the Suwad\\\". It is not clear what Maudud had been doing up to this time. Now he agreed to invade Jerusalem alongwithTugtakin and at his request. The allies met at Salamiya, near Hama, shortly after the i8th of June^ Then they marched south together through the Bika' and laid siege to Tiberias. Baldwin did not wait for the arrival of the reinforcements which were expected from Antioch and Edessa. The armyofJerusalem was numerically less inferior to the invaders, it may be supposed, than it had been to the much ^ I.A. i. 786, 781, Sibt iii. 544, Abu*l-mehasin, iii. 497 is to be corrected accordingly.

But when Baldwin advanced to raise the siege of Tiberias, having marched into an ambush, or having been taken by surprise in his camp', he suffered a very severe defeat (28th June 1113)^ Happily for the kingdom he himselfescaped and his forces rallied quicklyon the hills above the townandlake. Theywere joinedimmediately by large reinforcements, by pilgrims who had just arrived in Palestine and by the expected contingents from the north. For 26 days more the enemies faced one another. ThentheMoslems withdrew southwards towards Baisan with the intention of ravaging the country in that direction. They stayed there five days^' and scoured the country toward *Akka and Jerusalem. Nablus was destroyed. At the same time the inhabitants of Jerusalem were alarmed by a raid from Ascalon. But the Latin army kept close to the Moslem headquarters, and the invaders being short of provisions quickly left their new position and crossed the Jordan into the Hauran (beginning of August)*. Maudud dismissed his troops but decided to remain himself in Damascus for the winter. He entered the town on the 9th of September^ There he was assassinated in the court of the mosque after divine service on September I2th^ The effect of this event on the general progress of the Moslem contest with the Latins is explained in chapter II.

III3 Maudud they were saved from a repetition of the invasion of this year. Tugtakin, having lost his ally, was disposed to resume his policy of maintaining peace with Baldwin in the south. Besides, next year his relations with the sultan induced him to seek alliance with the Latin princes. Maudud was the sultan's brother and Tugtakin was suspected ofcomplicity in his death. Baldwin, for his part, seems never to have thought of undertaking the conquest of Damascus. He also was inclined to be at peace with his neighbour. There does not appear to have been anyfurther conflict between Damascus and Jerusalem until after Baldwin's death in 11 18. From this point the history of events in Jerusalem need not be narrated separately from the history of the northern states. The history of the making of the kingdom demanded separate treatment. In southern Syria the period of conquest ends practically with the year 1112. Two important towns on the coast were indeed unsubdued. Tyrewas not captured until 1124 and Ascalon not until 1153. But these captures were isolated events. The failure of the attack on Tyre in 1112 marks the end of the period of conquest. The date coincides remarkably with the commencement of a wave of Moslem advance. At first this advance was directed against the Latins of the north. But at once it affected the situation in Jerusalem also. Baldwin mo recognised the presence ofa common enemy. In and nil he took part in the defence of Edessa and Antioch against Maudud, and in return the rulers of these states joined Baldwin against Maudud in 1113. In these circumstances the history of the Latin states begins to flow in a single channel. The successive invaders of northern Syria become the principal enemies of the kingdom of Jerusalem and its history merges in the history of the north. Hence the statement already made that the course of events in Antioch and Edessa, as traced in chapter II, is the main stream of the present history. We must turn back and make a fresh start from the datewhen Bohemond and Baldwin founded their princedoms in the north. But first it will be convenient to summarise brieflythe events of the remaining years of Baldwin's reign (1114-1118) and certain incidents which occurred just after his death. There is69\",\"; A.D. III4-I6 BALDWIN I 65 little of note or importance to record. Affairs in the north demandedBaldwin'spresenceonlyonce, in the year 1115. There was peace with Damascus, as already observed. No further attempt was made to conquer Tyre, and Ascalon was left undisturbed. The immunity of the coast-towns may be attributed to Baldwin's lack of a fleet and to the failure of his great effort in the winter of 1111-12. On the Moslem side the Egyptian garrison of Ascalon was never wholly inactive. During the invasion of Maudud in 1113 an expedition from Ascalon threatened the town of Jerusalem^ Again when Baldwin was absent in the north in 1115 two attempts were made to surprise Jaffa (beginningofSeptember). A considerable fleet took part in the first attack, and it may have lasted some days. The second did notcontinuemore than six hours ; it was a renewal of the first after an interval of ten daysl In the autumn of 1115, after his return to Jerusalem, Baldwin built a castle, Shaubak, on a lofty eminence some distance to the south of the Dead Sea^ One object he had in view was to facilitate attacks on the caravans whichpassed thatway,comingandgoing to Egypt. Thename Mont Royal was given to the hill onwhich the castle stood in commemoration of the king's share in the building. Next year, 1116, Baldwin spentsometimeinexploring thecountryto the south of Palestine. He set out from Shaubak with a little cavalcade of horsemen and penetrated to Aila on the Red Sea. From there he advanced towards the monastery of Sinai, but turned back when he learned that the monks were unwilling that he should visit them. He entered Palestine again by way of Hebron. In the plains of Ascalon he made considerable booty before returning home*. Probably in con- sequence of these events El-afdal of Egypt asked for peace and ^ Fulcherii. 47. 2 Fulcher ii. 51.

III7-18 a truce was made with him\\\\ In March 1117 the king was seriously ill for a time at 'Akka. An Egj-ptian fleet lay ready in Tyre to take advantage ofhis death,should itoccur. Possibly the recapture of Tibnin, situated in the hills east of Tyre, may be dated towards the end of April in this year^ In June, or later, Baldwin built the castle of Iskanderun (Skandaleon) as a further protection against the garrison ofTyre'. His death took place in the following year. He was absent at the time from his kingdom, making an inroad into Egypt. The expedition was an adventurous one, for the king had with him only 6<X) men, 200 horsemenand 400foot-soldiers. His special purpose was to retaliate for the annoyance caused by the garrison of Ascalon. Possibly he hoped to make plunder and extort money as the price of peace. The expedition started in the second week of March. After twelve days marching it reached Faramia on the Nile (21st of March)*. The town was stormed and plundered on the following day ; two days were spent in resting ; on the third day while preparations for departure were being made the king fell ill. His sorrowing soldiers carried him homewards, but he died on the way back (2nd April 1118)». Five days later the body was carried into Jerusalem. Fortunately Baldwin of Edessa was in the city. He was unanimously chosen to be his uncle's successor*. It is remarkable how little Baldwin's expedition and his subsequent death stirred the activity of the Egyptian govern- ment. But Tugtakin endeavoured to profit by his opportunity. His terms of peace having been refused he crossed the Jordan * Sibt iii.558f., Abu'l-mehasiniii. 498.

But the Latins assembled an army which Tugtakin did not judge it prudent to attack. It included troops from Tripolis and Antioch. Two months passed, or more, without either side taking the offensive\\\\ At the end of this time Tugtakin returned to Damascus, probably because Ilgazi desired his co-operation in the north. About the same time the Latins made an expedition into the Hauran. They penetrated as far as Bosra and ravaged the country in its neighbourhood. The castle of Hubais was recaptured^ and the Moslem forces under Tugtakin's son Buri were defeatedI But Tugtakin did not allow these movements to deter him from joining Ilgazi in northern Syria. After consultation with his new ally Tugtakin gave up his plans in the south and agreed to join in a campaign against Antioch in the following summer*. Still peace was not renewed with Jerusalem, and the Latins of the south showed a disposition to continue their operations. Joscelin of Tiberias, in particular, was determined to avenge the recent invasion of his territory. He was leader, it seems, of the raid against Bosra in Iii8^ and in 1119 he made another similar expedition over the Jordan. A large number of Arabs were pasturingtheir flocks in the Hauran, relying on theprotection of Damascus. Joscelin set out to attack them with 60 foot-soldiers and 160 horsed He divided his force into three companies which lost touch at the critical moment. The main body was surrounded and cut to pieces ; the other divisions played a small part in the engagement and saved themselves by flight (30th 1 I.A. twomonths ; Fulcheriii. 1 almost3 months. 2 LA. i. 784.

He accepted, however, a sum of money and pledged himselfto leave the flocks ofthe Arabs henceforth undisturbed^ Possibly he still intended to attack the territories of Damascus^ But the death of Roger of Antioch on the 28th of June and the demands which the situation in the north made on Baldwin's attention put an end to any such intentions. In the autumn Joscelin himself left Tiberias to become lord of Edessa*. The Latin conquest ofsouthern Syria and the establishment in Palestine of a well-compacted Latin state were the work of Baldwin I morethan ofanyother individual. Only the very first steps towards this end had been taken before he came to the throne in the year after the fall of Jerusalem (iioo A.D.). His reign is made illustrious by the capture of a goodly series of Moslem towns and much of the credit is deservedly his own. His resources were never very great but he knew how to use them to the utmost advantage. He was conspicuous for personal valour and made his mark as a fighting king. But the creation of a stable government in the newly-founded state was also largely his achievement. It was his determination and, indeed, his high-handed treatment of opponents that shattered the project of an ecclesiastical or papal state in Palestine. Yet everyone deplored his loss, when he was laid to rest beside his brother Godfrey in the Church ofthe Holy Sepulchre. » Easter Sunday(Albert).

ANTIOCH AND EDESSA MOSLEM REACTION DOWN TO A ; .D. 1127. Edessa was the farthest north of the Latin princedoms. The circumstances of Baldwin's settlement there have been described in chapter I. It was in March 1098 that he became lord of Edessa. Soon afterwards he secured possession of Samsat (Samosata) and of SarujS both situated close at hand, to the north and southwest respectively. The occupation of Samsat brought Baldwin nearer to Constantine of Karkar, one of the most friendly of his Armenian allies. Their alliance was cemented and Baldwin's territory extended by his subsequent marriage to a niece of Constantine^ The only serious menace to the Latin occupation was in May 1098 when the army of Kerboga of Mosul passed through the district. He came at the beginning ofharvest and spent some weeks ravagingthecountry during this vulnerable season. Edessa itself was invested for three days^ After the defeat of Kerboga's army*, while the headquarters of the crusading army were at Antioch, Baldwin received considerable assistance from Godfrey and others of the Latin chiefs. His inclination to favour these western allies roused dissatisfaction amongst the Armenians and already there were signs that thelordship ofthe Latins would not permanently ^ Albertiii. 24-25. 2 Albert iii. 31. ^ Albertiv. 11-12.

In November of that year Baldwin left Edessa to visit Jerusalem and was absent from his princedom for about three months. When hehimselfsucceeded Godfrey in Jerusalem his nephew Baldwin II became ruler of Edessa (October iioo). Not long afterwards Sukman of Maridin attacked Saruj (January-February IIOI)^ Sukman's nephew Balak had been its ruler previous to the Latin occupation*. Baldwin attempted to raise the siege and was defeated. He escaped to Edessa and then set out for Antioch to get assistance. He returned with 600 horse and 7CXD foot under his command, and with these troops drove away the Moslems from Saruj, about a month from the date of his previous attempt. The fact that he had now to storm the city in order to gain an entrance is significant of the relations between himself and the Armenian population'. In iioi or 1102*, apparently, Joscelin of Courtenay settled in western Edessa as Baldwin's vassal. He shared the government ofthe countrywith Baldwin. His residence was Tell bashir and his fiefextended over a large part of Euphratesia. The district so occupied and ruled was bounded on thenorth and west by the ranges ofthe Taurus mountains which separated the Latins from the Moslemsof Asia Minor'. Itssouthern limits were defined by the territories of Antioch and Aleppo. The * Albertv. 15-17. Cf. chap. I,p. 23,n. 3. ' Theyearending13rd February 1100(Mt. Ed.i. 49).

The Armenian population ended here and with it the Latin suzerainty. The nearest Moslem emirate on this side was that of the Ortoks on the upper reaches of the Tigris. To the east and northeast Sukman ibn Ortok, before his death in 1105, ruled Maridin, Hisn kaifa, Nisibin and Diyar bekr. The Latins made no conquests at the expense of their Moslem neighbours. Even Harran, within an easy day's march south of Edessa, was always independent of the \\\"lords of Edessa and Saruj.\\\" The fact is explained by the character of the Latin occupation. Where the population was friendly the Latins garrisoned the towns and castles ofthe country. But they were few in number and too weak for aggressive wars. Western immigrants added little,numerically,tothegrowth ofsettlements so far away from Jerusalem. It is the relation of Edessa to Antioch that gives it importance in the history of the Latin colonies. Edessa was the shield ofAntiochagainst the Moslems of Mesopotamia and its natural ally against Aleppo. Little is recorded of its separate history and no attempt is made in this volume to follov/ it further. The main thread of the history of the north lies in Antioch. Bohemond was the founder and first prince of the Latin state of Antioch. He made the Normans the ruling power in northern Syria and so created an independent princedom for himself The whole character of the Latin occupation was influenced by his action and example. But his personal share in the development was small, for the period of his government was short. The first stage ofthe enterprise which he undertook when he joined the crusade had been accomplished by the commencement of 1099. The most important town in Syria was his capital. From the walls of Antioch he commanded a country which promised him a fair inheritance. Already not a few of the towns and castles east of Antioch were in the possession of his soldiers. His position was acknowledged by the chiefs of the crusading army and so far his footing was secure. But these achievements were only the first steps in the founding ofhis princedom. Neither the extent nor the limits of Latin power were marked as yet by definite borders. Even76\",\"72 ANTIOCH AND EDESSA: A.D. IO99-IICX) within his sphere of influence Bohemond was not supreme. There were Moslem garrisons unsubdued and a Moslem popula- tion ready to revolt at the earliest opportunity. The task of establishing a Latin principality in northern Syria was also complicated by the rivalry of the emperor Alexius. He was determined to enforce the historic claims ofthe Greek empire by every means in his power. Following in the track of the first crusade his armies had recovered much of Asia Minor and had brought the borders of the empire near to Syria. In 1099 o^ 1100 the Cilician towns which Tancred had conquered were occupied by the Greeks*. Laodicea was theirs already and Bohemond vainly attempted to wrest it from them'. For a time he may have thought it possible to ignore their advance while he sought to strengthen his position at the expense of Aleppo. But the menace in his rear was too serious to be ignored Antioch itself was unsafe and a struggle with the ; empire was inevitable. Finally the pressure of these facts de- termined Bohemond to leave Syria and to return to Europe in the autumn of 1104. In northern Syria Aleppo was the principal Moslem town and therefore the chief rival of the Latins of Antioch. It lay between Antioch and Edessa, directly to the south of Euphra- tesia, or the country of Joscelin. The first dependencies of Antioch were west and south of Aleppo in districts which had been subject to Rudwan. In the spring of 1 100 Bohemond led his forces in this direction. The crops were destroyed in the fields round Famiya and the city was harassed for several days (May)'. Early in June* Rudwan advanced to the rescue. After spending some days beside Atharib he marched to Kella. There he was attacked and defeated and 5(X) of his men were taken prisoners (5th July iicxd). Immediately afterwards Kafr Haleb and the castle of Hadir were captured by the Latins'. * GestaTancredi,ch. 143 ; thedateisvaguelydefined asprevioustoBohemond'g capture (July 1100). * Seechap.

IIOO BOHEMOND'S CAPTURE 73 Encouraged bythese events Bohemond began to prepare for the siege of Aleppo^ Stores were collected and a Latin army assembled at El-mushrifa on the southern side of the town. A day or two later Bohemond's plans were completely changed. A messenger came from Gabriel the Armenian governor of Malatiya announcing that he was attacked by a Moslem emir, Kumushtakin ibn Danishmend, and offering possession of the town in return for help. With 300 horsemen Bohemond started at once for Malatiya. It was a disastrous undertaking. On the road, near Mar'ash, he was intercepted and made prisoner by Ibn Danishmend. When Baldwin of Edessa heard the news he made an attempt to rescue him. But Kumushtakin retreated beyond Malatiya and Baldwin was too weak to maintain the pursuit. He left 50 soldiers to strengthen the garrison of Malatiya and returned to Edessa^. It was just after this^ in the latter part of July, that news of Godfrey's death reached the north. Had Bohemond been at liberty he would have attempted no doubt to secure the throne of Jerusalem. It is not however certain, as has been supposed, that his success would have involved the union of all Syria in one Latin princedom. Nor is it clear in what way the conflict in the north between Antioch and Aleppo would have been influenced by Bohemond's departure south. Probably his mischance affected more his personal history than the wider ^ Kem. iii. 589wronglyprefersA.H. 595 but mentions that there is authorityfor anearlierdate.

The controlling elements of the situation were stronger than the influence of any one individual. Overtures forBohemond's ransom soon reached Kumushtakin from several quarters. Alexius was anxious tosecure possession of such a dangerous enemy and offered large sums for his surrender. The Armenian prince Basil kogh of Kaisun and Baldwin II, the new ruler of Edessa, exerted themselves with A more disinterestedness on behalf of the captive\\\\ year and a half passed before the negotiations came to a successful termination. Kumushtakin accepted the lesser ransom which was offered by Bohemond's friends. He was influenced by the desire of obtaining an ally against his rival Kilij Arslan. Bohemond was released shortly before Easter of the year 1103', along with his nephew Richard, who had been captured at the same time as himself*. During the greater part of Bohemond's captivity Tancred ruled in Antioch. The decision to invite him north was easily come to. As Bohemond's nephew and the conqueror of Cilicia he had a double claim to the vacant post. But Tancred was embarked on a career of his own in Palestine and hesitated to sacrifice the opportunities which Godfrey's death presented to him there. It was only after he was compelled to submit to Baldwin's authority in the south that he preferred the prospects that were open to him in Antioch (spring iioi). Throughout the autumn and winter the presence of a Genoese fleet had been a security to the town and the occasion of some operations against the Moslems*. But neither at this time nor after Tancred's arrival was there much danger of attack from the other side. When the Latins retired from El-mushrifa, Rudwan ^ Mt.

Immediately afterwards he was attacked and defeated by Jenah ed-daula of Horns and compelled to stand on the defensive against him\\\\ Instead of combining their forces against Antioch the Moslem emirs quarrelled with one another. During iioi Asia Minor was invaded by the hosts of a \\\"second crusade\\\" which foolishly endeavoured to rescue Bohemond on its wayto Palestine. Three separate armies, one after another, were routed and dispersed by the forces of several confederate emirs. Only fragments of the expedition reached Syria and its influence on the history of the Latin states was insignificant. For a time these events ' occupied Rudwan's attention and he appears to have joined in the repulse of the invaders His quarrels with Jenah ed-daula 2. of Homs also continued. Rudwan favoured the Persian sect of \\\"Esoterics\\\" (Batanians) who were extending their influence in / northern Syria. They based their power on the systematic practice of assassination and being known also as Assassins'* gave that word its present meaning. Rudwan's patronage of the sect was a cause of estrangement between him and his Moslem neighbours. He remained at enmity with Jenah ed- daula until the assassination of that emir in May 1103. Naturally Rudwan was suspected of complicity in the deed. But Horns became a dependency of Damascus*. Tancred meantime devoted himself chiefly to war with the Greeks. Baldwin of Edessa does not seem to have welcomed his arrivals and this made the relations of the two princes unfriendly from the first. Without the co-operation of Edessa it was natural that operations against Aleppo should paused Besides no attempt had yet been made to check the course of Greek aggression. In iioi Tancred recovered the Cilician towns which had been lost in the preceding year. Then he proceeded to attack Laodicea. The siege was prolonged for a 1 Kem. iii.589f.

In September 1 102 when Baldwin I was hard pressed in the south Tancred and Baldwin of Edessa made a joint expedition to his relief. Early in 1103, after Tancred's return, a notable success was gained. A large part of the garrison of Laodicea sallied out against the besiegers and was cut off. Shortly afterwards the town surrendered'. Tancred's victories of course provoked reprisals. The Italian fleets whose help was ofsuch vital consequence to thewelfare of the Latin colonies were pursued and attacked by Greek squadrons^ In the summer of 1103 an army was sent by land to recover Cilicia. But the Armenians were still faithful and the campaign was fruitless*. Bohemond's release put fresh life into the Moslem war. His policy was to attack the lands between Antioch and Edessa in alliance with Baldwin II. The northern states were thus united in one enterprise advantageous to both. It was also part of Bohemond's purpose to isolate Aleppo from Mesopotamia by the conquest of Harran and the districts south of Edessa. This was the issue at stake in the campaign of 1104. It is not surprising that such far-reaching plans united in some degree the Moslem opposition. At the end of 1 103, when the activity of the Latins had become apparent, Jakarmish of Mosul and Sukman of Maridin laid aside their feuds and prepared to take the field next spring. A most fortunate Moslem victory secured the safetyofthe territorieswhichwere in jeopardy and indirectly brought Bohemond's career in Syria to its conclusion.

The Latins released their prisoners with the exception of those taken at El-musliniiya^ Tribute was imposed on the districts of El-'awasim and Kinnesrin'^. In November the troops of Edessa made a successful expedition against Rakka and Ja'barl It was in this direction that the Latins intended to strike next year. Baldwin's raid against the territories of Maridin in this same year^ was no part of the general plan. But the capture of Basarfut at the end of March 1104, by the troopsofEdessa'',helpedtosecure the road between Antioch and Edessa and was a preliminary to the following campaign. In the spring of 1104 the allies laid siege to Harran^ Very soon news came that a Moslem army was approaching and the Latins marched out to meet them. A battle was fought two days later. The first division of the Latin army, under Baldwin and Joscelin, was routed and its leaders captured. The rear division under Bohemond and Tancred took no part in the engagement. They were pursued, however, as they retreated and lost severely at the crossing ofthe river Balikh(May 1104)'. The fugitives rallied in Edessa, where the citizens were greatly alarmed at the news of Baldwin's capture. Bohemond returned to Antioch but Tancred remained to protect and govern the province. Eight days later Jakarmish appeared and encamped against the city. Messengers were sent to Antioch asking help. The siege lasted only fifteen days.

The Moslems were driven away in headlong flight and their routwas completed by Bohemond,who arrived opportunely at this very momenta In Edessa all danger was now past. It was otherwise in Antioch. The recent defeat had revealed in a most startling manner the insecurity ofthe tenure by which the Latins held their possessions there. The Greeks used the opportunity to attack Laodicea and the seaports on the coast towards Tripolis; throughout the countrythe Moslempopulation watched every movement of the Latin garrisons even the ; Armenians who had welcomed the Latins as deliverers were ready to transfer their allegiance to Rudwan of Aleppo. Antioch was crowded with fugitives from theoutlyingtowns and manysurrendered in panic to the Moslems on the assurancethat I their lives would be spared*. It is not easy to estimate the number of the Latin strongholds which actually changed hands. The Armenian inhabitants of Artah admitted Rudwan's soldiers to the town' and no doubt there were other similar cases in which the Moslems gained the upper hand without striking a blow*. Still the opportunity for such changes was brief and Rudwan was not the man to use it to the best advantage. He raided the country as far as the iron bridge over the Orontes on the way to Antioch'. But there was no attempt on his part at serious operations either before or after Bohemond 's return. Schemes for the occupation of Damascus attracted him more than war with the Latins*. Bohemond might easily have restored confidence and retrieved the situationhad Rudwanbeen his only enemy. It was the perpetual hostility of the Greek empire which threatened him with ruin.

It began with a casual attack on Laodicea by Kantakouzenos. He had just been pursuing a Genoese fleet without success and probably learned that the opportunity was favourable for an attack on Laodicea^ The harbour was captured at the first assault and the town was occupied apparently without resistance. The citadel continued in possession of its garrison, a force of 600 men. When the emperor learned what the position of affairs was he sent an army overland to co-operate with the fleet. As it marched through Cilicia on its way the Latin garrisons were expelled by the inhabitants of the Cilician towns and the Greeks were received with open arms^. Before it reached Laodicea Kanta- kouzenos hadgained several seaports in the direction ofTripolis. The date ofthe capture of the citadel is unknown. It still held I out when Bohemond returned from Edessa, for he provisioned it afresh and changed its garrison. Probablyits capture influenced his decision to leave Antioch at the end of summer. He recognised that his forces were unequal to the conflict which the fatal enmity of Greece imposed. He summoned Tancred to Antioch and informed him that he had decided to leave the princedom in his hands while he himself sailed to Europe to raise fresh forces. He left Syria at the close of summer\\\", never to return. In France and elsewhere his appeals for help met with an enthusiastic response. Having gathered a large army he resolved to attack his arch enemy Alexius in Europe. In the latter part of 1107 he laid siege to Durazzo. The attempt to strike a decisive blow in this direction proved a failure. Within a year he was compelled to accept the terms dictated to him by the emperor. He acknowledged Alexius' title to all his Syrian possessions and swore to be his faithful vassal ^ Anna i. 86ff. As this is the fleetwhich took part in the sieges ofJubailand *Akka (May6-26) the dateis probablyin the monthof April. The decisionof the admiral to attack Laodicea may have been due to his knowledge of Bohemond's absenceratherthantothenewsofthe disasternear Harran. 2 GestaTancredi, ch. 151. 3 Fulcher ii. 25. Romoaldvii. 178 says he arrived inApuliain December 1105 (?read December 1104) for which the chronicle of Bari in Muratori v. 155 gives January 1105.84\",\"I 80 BOHEMOND AND TANCRED A.D. II08-I (September 1108)*. The remaining years of his life were spent in the vain effort to raise another army. He died in the year nil. So passed away the ablest of the Latin princes and the most notable figure in the first crusade. It is tempting to imagine that had he remained in Syria until his death he would have guided the fortunes of Antioch so that it would have prospered and grown to something greater than it ever became. In correction of such a view it is to be remembered that Bohemond's attack on the empire in Europe, although itself a failure, contributed much to the security which Tancred enjoyed throughout his career as ruler and builder up of Antioch. It has been argued that Bohemond need not have wasted his strength in Europe and should have led his forces back with him to Syria in 1107. But it may be doubted if such a policy would have succeeded better than that which he adopted. The conquest of Aleppo would certainly have given the Norman princedom a power and extent which it never had and would have cleared the way for the further conquest ofall Syria by the Latins. But was it possible for Bohemond to accomplish this in 1107? The power ofAleppo was much greater for resistance than for attack, and its neighbours would never have left it to its fate without some assistance. But above all the struggle with Greece was inevitable. If not in Europe, it had still to be fought in Cilicia or Syria, and without any prospect of more success. The claims of the empire demanded their victim and it was Bohemond's hard fate to supply it Rudwan of Aleppo was not an enemy from whom Tancred iiad much to fear. He does not appear to have realised at all adequately the menace of the situation which was created by the presence of the Latins in Syria. He treated them as he might have treated any Turkish emirate newly established in his neighbourhood. Love of war and the lust of conquest, characteristics then of his race, inspired him singularly little. When victories over the Latins were gained by others he was bold enough to venture a blow against them. But when he was attacked in return.he submitted timorously or was disheartened by the issue of a single battle. His resources were probably ^ Anna i. 186.85\",\"A.D. 1105 TANCRED 81 inadequate,but such as they were he showed neither energy nor capacity in the use of them. The flickering efforts which he made were easily extinguished. So Tancred found in 1105. In that year he opened his first campaign alter Bohemond's departure. Rudwan was preparing to march to the relief of Tripolis^ when he heard that Artah was besieged. He led his forces against the Latins and was decisively defeated in the neighbourhood of the castle (20th April 1105)^ Artah was deserted by its garrison and Tancred took possession. When Rudwan shut himself up in Aleppo it was the turn of the Moslem population in the smaller towns to seek refuge along with him in their metropolis. For a time the Latins scoured the country and before the summer was over all the territory they had lost in the preceding year was again securely in their possession. Serious military operations may not have been required to accomplish this results In some cases, at least, it was enough simply to re-occupy the positions which had been evacuated, and the more important castles, whatever they were, may have been secured by treaty rather than by capture. Rudwan must have sued for peace and been granted it on Tancred's terms. What these were is nowhere explicitly stated. But the continuance of peace during the next five years almost certainly implies that Rudwan was Tancred's submissive tributary during all that time. The Latin prince was at liberty to extend his borders by the conquest of the castles and petty towns which were ruled by the independent emirs of northern Syria. The wars which Rudwan waged were in Mesopotamia with Moslem emirs^ 1 Rajab498,ending 17thApril (Sibtiii. 529); Kern.iii. 593,wherethetranslation wronglyimpliesthat RudwanwenttothehelpofTripolis. 2 3 Sha'ban, Kem. iii. 593; Fulcher ii. 29, April.

Probably the western knights who lorded it over the population of the country were satisfied with the situation, but not so the unhappy Armenians, their subjects. The Latins were no protection against Moslem invaders and they were themselves a cruel scourge. According to the Armenian historian^ they robbed and oppressed their subjects and treated with contempt their religious rites and all their customs. The population decreased, the churches fell into ruin and the cultivation of the ground was neglected. Weak and timid as the Armenians appear to havebeen,suchconductbegan to drive them to revolt*. It was well for the Latins that the Moslems round aboutweresoengrossed incivilstrife. Jakarmish had to contend with a host of enemies, chief among them the sultan Mohammed himself. Even Kilij Arslan of Rum joined in the fray. In 1106 he attacked Harran. In 1107 he en- deavoured to secure MosuP. His career ended in August of that year when he was defeated by Jawali^ and drowned in his flight.

Among the most significant events of 1106 and 1107 are Kilij Arslan's fearless marches across the territories of Edessa^ The power of the Latins, in fact, extended no further than the walls of their fortified towns. When the Turksattacked Basil theArmenian (i107)hedefended himself without assistance from Antioch or Edessa^. To the west ofEdessa purely Armenian princes were establishing states oftheir own. During all these years Baldwin and Joscelin were prisoners, first of Jakarmish, then of Jawali. Tancred took no trouble to secure their deliverance, his enemies said that he put obstacles in the way. Finally in 1108 the course of events in Mosul led to their release. Jawali incurred the sultan's displeasure and was suspected of disloyalty. Maudud, Mohammed's brother, was sent with an army to reduce him to obedience. Jawali fortified Mosul, left it in charge of his wife, who was a daughter or sister of Bursuk of Hamadan', and set off to gain allies and create a diversion outside the city. He took Baldwin and Joscelin with him and shortly afterwards released them. The terms on which he did so speak for themselves. The Latin princes were required to pay a ransom, to liberate their Moslem prisoners and to give Jawali help whenever danger threatened his person, his army or his possessions. They were set at liberty about the middle of August 1 108*. A rare opportunitynow presented itselffor striking a blow at the Moslems on the borders ofEdessa. The siege ofMosul was [ ^ Accordingto Mt.

If Tancred were well disposed and joined his forces to those of Edessa much could be accomplished. But Tancred would not lay aside his enmity to Baldwin, and would not even permit his quiet restoration to his old possessions. Baldwin and Joscelin made their headquarters at Tell bashir and there Tancred hurried to attack them. Some time was spent in negotiations and indecisive skirmishing^.

His opponents were too strong to be driven out of their possessions' and a formal reconciliation was effected in the following year. But the golden opportunity had passed and seeds offresh bitter- ness had been sown.

Baldwin of Edessa,Joscelin and Tancred were all present. Bertram claimed that part ofAntioch which Raymond had once possessed\\\", so Tancred became a supporter of William of Cerdagne. When the rival claims were settled he gained an extension ofterritorybybecomingWilliam's overlord. Besides he received back his former Palestinian pos- sessions, Tiberias, Nazareth and Haifa. For them he swore allegiance to the king. The price of his gains was a formal resignation of all claims to Edessa^ Tancred's policy now was to extend his possessions in the direction of Tripolis. He devoted himself to the task with energy and success. After the capture of Tripolis (12th July 1109) the services of the Genoese fleet enabled him to subdue two of the neighbouring coast-towns. Balanyas was occupied without resistance and Jabala surrendered the very day it was attacked (23rd July)*. Possibly the troops of Tancred had already harassed the latter town during the recent siege of Tripolis'. Fakhr el-mulk escaped to Damascus and settled there*.

IIIO MOSLEM REACTION 87 el-akrad was captured from the Moslems^ Tugtakin had been assured that Hisn el-akrad and Masyafshould beleft untouched, but that was presumably Bertram's promise and did not bind Tancred. Several attacks were made on Shaizar aboutthistime and it also paid tribute to Antioch^ mo The year is a turning-point in the history of the Latin occupation. The European concert had thrown its armies on the shores of Syria and had established colonies all along the coast. Steadily the new settlements extended, occupying the intervals between them and gradually spreading inland. As the tide covers a rocky beach, advancing swiftly at one point, more slowly at another, leaving little islands behind in itsgeneral progress, surrounding rocks with its dashing waves before it has strength to cover them, so the Latins advanced in Syria. There was no organised opposition to their progress and no systematic war was waged against them. No spiritofnationalunityexisted to inspire opposition to their conquests and as yet nothing had mo appeared to take its place. The year marks the beginning of a change ; with it a period of Moslem reaction set in. Mesopotamia was the starting-point of the new movement. There the sultan and the caliph embodied the idea of Moslem unityand acknowledged an abstract responsibility forthe welfare ofthe Moslem world. When Fakhr el-mulk of Tripolis in 1108 visited Bagdad to implore the sultan's help hereceived apromise ofassistance. In the winter of 1109,after the fall ofTripolis,he renewed his appeals The bare facts of the situation in Syria spoke eloquently on their own behalf The contest for the possession of Mosul was at an end. Its gifted ruler Sharafed- daula Maudud was the leader whom the times demanded. With the sanction and encouragement of his brother, the sultan Mohammed, he roused the faithful once again to engage in the Holy War. During the four brief years which remained of his life he never drew back from the task to which he thus devoted himself And when he died he bequeathed a duty and example which were not forgotten. Hereditary ambition, religious duty, j and hopes of conquest in Syria all inspired the emirs of the Mesopotamian towns to continue the work Maudud began. 1 Sibtiii. 539. 2 Sibtiii. 537f.92\",\"88 MOSLEM REACTION: A.D. 11lO The movement which overthrew the Latin states was initiated by this emir. Preparations for Maudud's first campaign began in December f liiOQ^ He was joined by Ilgazi ibn Ortok of Maridin and others. It was agreed to attack the town of Edessa. In the month following the 23rd of April the siege commenced^ Tancred of Antioch appears to have made no movement and the Latins of Jerusalem were Baldwin's only hope of succour. Their willing response was a good omen for the future. About the beginning of June Baldwin of Jerusalem set out in p>erson for the north. He took with him 700 horsemen and 300 foot- soldiers and a month was spent on the road. Basil kogh and other Armenian chiefs joined the expedition as it advanced in the direction of Samsat'. The besieging army retired towards Harran, where it was reinforced by Tugtakin and the troops of Damascus*. On both sides such co-operation was something new. Even Tancred was persuaded to join the Latins with 1500 men, and made formal acknowledgment of his obligation to be loyal and faithful to the common cause'. At first the Latins advanced and the Moslems retired. But Tancred became suspicious of his allies and withdrew his troops to Samsat*. Then Baldwin decided to provision Edessa and to escort out of danger those ofthe inhabitants who choseto leave. A multitude ofrefugees from the town and the country put themselves under his protection. When the Euphrates was reached there were only a few boats and rafts to take them across. As they were being slowly ferried over, the Turkish army charged them in the rear. Most of the knights were already on the further side.

He was also attacked and the result was a second disaster. He narrowly escaped capture and a return to his Moslem prison-house. But troops from the main army, sent to his assistance, found him and escorted him safelyinto Edessa\\\\ Afterthis Baldwin ofJerusalem and Tancred returned home. Baldwin ravaged the Bika* as he marched southward 2. The invasion of Edessa had lasted about / 100 days and the whole province had suffered greatly^ ^ Six years previously the defeat of the Latins in Edessa had •encouraged Rudwan to commence hostilities with Antioch. In 1110 he grasped eagerly at what seemed a similar opportunity. Regardless of his treaty obligations he invaded Tancred'sf territory. He secured considerable spoil and made a number of' Armenian prisoners, chiefly peasantry it may be supposed. But when Tancred returned from Edessa in perfect safety and Rudwan heard the news he withdrew at once to Aleppo*. The Latins ravaged the districts through which they passed on their way back, and occupied En-nakira, which was deserted by its inhabitants^ This was only a foretaste of more serious operations. A few miles to the west of Aleppo three fortresses, Artah, Atharib and Zaredna stretched in a chain from north to south. The security of Aleppo depended largely on their preservation. Artah was already in the hands ofthe Latins, the other two were now also captured*^. Atharib was first attacked^ ^ Thislastincidentisrelated byAlbert,whosegeneralaccountisfullest(xi.19-25).

IIIO-II The tremendous strokes of Tancred's battering ram rang in the defenders' ears long afterwards as they told the story of the siege. Rudwan negotiated in vain on behalf of the strictly invested castle. A carrier pigeon sent by the garrison with news of their desperate straits alighted in the besiegers* camp and its message assured Tancred of success. An attempt to mine the ground beneath the tents of the besiegerswasbetrayed, provisions ran short in the castle and the garrison, despairing of relief, accepted Tancred's terms. He granted them their lives mo and liberty (between 15th December and 12th January liii)^ After this success Zaredna proved an easy prey. Its capture^ and that of Atharib made the situation of Aleppo critical in the extreme. Of Atharib Ibn el-athir says that it \\\"held Aleppo by the throat.\\\" Panic fell on the population of all the smaller towns and villages that were still dependent on the Moslem capital. Mambij and Balis were deserted by their inhabitants and burned by Tancred's orders^ Rudwan sued for peace and by offering a large sum ofmoney obtained a truce which was to last until the harvest season was past^ Tancred had meantime other plans to complete. He proceeded to the siege and capture of the castle of Bikisrayil which lay on the hills to the east of Jabala. It may be supposed that this is the castle which Albert of Aix names Vetula. If so the siege commenced about mid-February and lasted three months. When the destruction wrought by Tancred's engines had made the castle indefensible it was evacuated by its garrison.

Tancred returned to Atharib and the threat of his presence at such a time secured prompt payment and submission to fresh demands,which may be regarded as the penalty of Rudwan's breach of faith2. After this the Latin prince proceeded once more to Shaizar. He began to build a fortress on Tell ibn Ma'shar and he was still employed in its construction or rebuilding when news came that Maudud had laid siege to Tell bashir^ (end ofJune). mo Maudud's campaign in had caused terror and dismay throughout Edessa but had not materially altered the situation there. In Syria from the Moslem point of view affairs were becoming worse; Tancred's power grew steadily and Aleppo lay almost at his mercy. Some who had suffered from his ravages betook themselves to Bagdad and stirred up excitement and religious zeal by describing the situation in Syria. On Fridays they interrupted the preachers in the mosques and clamoured that the armies of Islam should be sent against the Latins. There were riots which penetrated into the very palace of the caliph. The sultan urged his emirs to devote themselves to the holy war. He sent his son Mas'ud to act along with Maudud at the head of the army^ It was resolved to besiege Tell bashir. In May or June, before preparations were quite complete, Maudud attacked some Latin castles near Edessa.

On the other hand the Mesopotamian emirs hadexhausted their energies, they saw no more prospect of success against Tripolis than against Tell bashir, and they were asked to advance further from their homes that others might reap an uncertain advantage.

From the time the allies left Aleppo^ Tancred had lain watching them at Er-ruj. He was joined there by Baldwin of Jerusalem and Bertram of Tripolis on the loth of September. Next day the Latins marched to Famiya and there they mustered in full force. On the third day they advanced towards Shaizar^. The Moslems were superior to the Latins in mobility and avoided a pitched battle. On their swift horses they encircled the Latin army and scoured the countryround about. Their opponents suffered from scarcity of food and forage. On the fifteenth daytheskirmishing was more serious than usual and the Moslems held the advantage. On the sixteenth day, which was the feast of St Michael the archangel, the Latins retired to their own territory (29th September). The Moslem army then dispersed and Tancred's allies returned home^ Rudwan gained nothing by his refusal to join the Moslem invaders this summer. Without even dispersing his troops Tancred resumed his campaign of the previous year against the castles of Aleppo. In October he besieged 'Ezaz* and would not accept Rudwan's offer of twenty thousand pieces of gold which he was willing to pay if the Latins gave up their enterprise.

But Tugtakin did not fulfil his promises^ The siege of Tyre commenced on the 30th of November and he departed to southern Syria', where his own special interests were at stake. *Ezaz was left to its fate. Shortly after Christmas the castle keep became so ruined that it fell and brought down with it in its fall two neighbouring towers. The assailants fought with the defenders hand to hand through a breach in the wall, but the resistance of the garrison was still so formidable that Tancred agreed to grant them terms of surrender. The castle was given up to the Latins and the defenders withdrew in safety. It was Tancred's last conquest and it does not appear to have been maintained long after his death. Next year (i 112) was the year of Tancred's death, probably in December'. In the summer he waged war with Basil kogh and captured Ra'ban. The Armenian prince died soon after peace was made (12th October)*. Tancred himself did not survive much longer. His career coincides with the first period ofthe historyofthe crusaders in the east and mirrors its leading features. Along with Bohemond he founded the Latin state of Antioch. More than Bohemond he determined the final extent and boundaries of the princedom. During the ten years of his rule (i 101-03, 1 104-12) he preserved and extended itsterritories in every direction.

While Tancred lived the conquering spirit of the first crusade lived on. He never laid aside his sword nor rested on his laurels. It has been charged against him that he lacked the statesmanlike ability and foresight of Bohemond, that his enmity to Baldwin was a source of weakness, that he never attempted to occupy Aleppo, and that his relations with the Armenians were not satisfactory. The charges may be true. But now that the storm ofMoslem attack was breaking over the Latin colonies it was a grave loss for such as Tancred to be taken from them. The danger of the next generation was that they should become mere defenders of inherited possessions. Tancred was a princedom maker and would have continued to aim at further conquests\\\\ Maudud's third campaign, in 1112, was directed against Edessa. He appeared before the city unexpectedly on Easter Monday, the 23rd of April. For eight or ten weeks the Moslems invested Baldwin's capital seeking, probably, to reduce it by starvation rather than by direct attack. Towards the conclusion of the siege Joscelin was posted in Saruj, and surprised a large body of Maudud's horsemen who were seeking pasture in the neighbourhood (15th June). They lost their baggage and many of their horses, some were slain and a few prisoners were taken. Maudud found no opportunity of retaliation although he spent a week in the neighbourhood of Saruj after this reverse. Joscelin joined Baldwin in Edessa and Maudud returned to his former post. The siege ended with the failure of an attempt to gain admittance to the town by the help of traitors. The sufferings of the inhabitants induced certain ofthem to admit the enemytoatowerwhichcommanded the eastern wall. But there was only a brief struggle on the ramparts in the darkness before the Moslems were driven headlong by the impetuous valour of the Latin chiefs. The ^ Tancred's career receives very suggestive treatment in a booklet byBernhard Kugler(BoemundundTankred, 1862)but thefaultsof hischaracterand policyseem to be unduly emphasised. The sudden pause in the activity of the Latins under Tancred's nephew and successor, Roger son of Richard, is very striking.100\",\"96 SHARAF ED-DAULA MAUDUD A.D. III3 inhabitants were severely punished for this act of treachery. Tell mauzen was captured by the retiring army'. In 1113 the friendship of Tugtakin and Maudud bore important fruit. The hope long cherished by Tugtakin that the emirs beyond the Euphrates would come to the rescue of their Syrian brothers in the faith was now in a measure realised. Maudud devoted himselfthis year whollyto a Syrian campaign. In the beginning of May^ it seems, he crossed the Euphrates. For six weeks his movements are a matter ofconjecture. Some time was spent in fruitless negotiations with Rudwan'. In the latter part of June Maudud and Tugtakin were encamped beside Salamiya and there it was decided to invade Palestine. The subsequent course of the campaign has been related in chapter I*. It was not the desire of territorial gain which prompted Maudud to an expedition so far from his own possessions. Like the soldiers ofthe first crusade he sought the deliverance of Jerusalem and the Holy Land. He thus antici- pated by many years the aspirations of Nureddin and Saladin. The cause of Moslem reaction was seriously checked by his untimely death in September and, possibly, was driven into a narrower channel. For a time the emirs of Mesopotamia and Syria waged war with one another and when the contest with the Latins was resumed it took the form of a struggle for the possession of Aleppo (1118-1128). Probably in the latter part of 1113 Joscelin ceased to be lord of Tell bashir. He was deprived of his fief by Baldwin of Edessa in consequence of a quarrel which took place between them. In Jerusalem king Baldwin granted him the lordship of Tiberias'. Maudud'sdeathbroughtnoimmediaterespiteto Edessa.

The investment lasted a month, from the 15th of May, until it was broken up because of the difficulty of obtaining supplies. Before the Moslems retired from the province they ravaged the country along the banks of the Euphrates and inflicted considerable loss. At Samsat overtures were made to them by the widow of Basil kogh. She placed herself under Moslem protection and the Latins were expelled from Kaisun, Mar'ash and Ra'banl El-burski's advancement by the sultan was viewed with jealousy by Ilgazi of Maridin and he took no share personally in the campaign against Edessa. El-burski after his return avenged the slight by laying waste the territory of Maridin. In 1115 Ilgazi retaliated and El-burski was defeated in a battle fought towards the end of May^. The quarrel provoked the sultan's displeasure on both parties. El-burski was deprived of the emirate of Mosul and retired to Rahaba where he lived in obscurity for some years. Ilgazi fled to Syria to concert measures of defence with Tugtakin, who was also under suspicion since Maudud's assassination in Damascus. The immediate sequel of these events was an invasion of Syria by the armies ofthe sultan and the formation of a Syrian league in which Moslems and Christians united to resist the invaders. The Latins bore the brunt of the fighting, but they fought as the allies of Ilgazi and Tugtakin. Rudwan of Aleppo died on the loth of December 1113^. Power really passed into the hands of a certain Lulu el-yaya, who made first one and then another of Rudwan's sons nominal emir.

Tugtakin broke off all relations with Lulu who then appealed for help to the sultan. When Ilgazi joined Tugtakin in the summer of 1 1 15 they decided to occupy Aleppo, that it might not fall into the hands of the sultan's army. This accomplished, it was further resolved to make alliance with the Latins. Roger of Antioch had completed his preparations in expectation of war, but gladly listened to the overtures which were made to him. The allies joined forces at Famiya in June, Roger with 2000 men, it is said, and the Moslems with a larger number, estimated at 10,000'. Two months passed before the alliance was put to the test. In the month of August' Bursuk of Hamadan' invaded Syria as the sultan's representative and chief commander. His principal Syrian supporters were the emirs of Homs and Shaizar. He was instructed to hand over his conquests to Kirkhan of Homs. Before the invaders reached Aleppo, Ilgazi and Tugtakin garrisoned the town with their troops^ Bursuk therefore passed on to Hama. It yielded without much resistance and was occupied by Kirkhan'. A few days later the sultan's army advanced to Shaizar. The Latins were still in their original position not far away. When the enemy approached Roger gave orders that his soldiers should not leave the camp on any pretext. Bursuk vainly employed every artifice to provoke them to an engagement. Roger waited for the arrival of his allies. Baldwin of Jerusalem, Pons of Tripolis and the con- federate Moslem emirs« soon joined him and greatly increased ' Walteri. ».

In their uncertainty they attacked El-jisr, which had recently been captured from them, and burned its suburbs. Still the hostile army did not appear, and the purpose of the allies seemed to be accomplished. Tugtakin marched towards Damascus, saying that he feared attack in that direction^ The Latins dispersed their forces. But Bursuk was still in Syria. With alarming swiftness he descended on Kafr tab, which was captured and destroyed on the 3rd of September^ Thenhe advancedtoMa*araten-nu'man. For a whole week the districts round lay at the mercy of his plundering bands. But his forces lacked coherence, like every Mesopotamian army composed of miscellaneous levies.

Walter, chancellor of Antioch, has left a full account of the Latin movements.

On the day following astheyapproached theirnextcamping ground a scout brought word that the Moslems were there already in the very act of pitching their tents. It was the festival of the elevation of the cross and therefore a day of happy omen. The bishop of Jabala carried the cross up and down the ranks, the soldiers knelt before it three times in reverence, and having thus commended themselves to God they mounted their horses. When the Latins swept down on the Moslem tents only the baggage animals and the servants were there. Bursuk's troops straggled up in detachments and were defeated as they arrived. Bursuk attempted to rally his men on the slope of a neigh- bouring hill, but finding that success was hopeless, he saved himself by flight. The Latins secured much plunder. No doubt the spoil and the prisoners of the recent campaign were for the most part recovered (14th September 1115)'. Roger remained on the field for two or three days\\\" dividing the spoil. He was received in Antioch with much enthusiasm and publicly gave thanks to God for his great victory in the church of St Peter. Kafr tab and Ma'ara were rebuilt by the Latins. The peculiar situation of 1 1 15 did not continue. Ilgazi and Tugtakin both effected their reconciliation with the sultan. They had not compromised themselves unduly by their cautious movements in the recent campaign and Roger's victory at Danith was a warning to the Moslems to close their ranks.

But Roger or his counsellors lacked initiative^ During the four years which followed Tancred's death (ill3- 16) there were no hostilities between Antioch and Aleppo. Even the victory at Danith produced no change of policy. In 1117 Roger played the part of protector to Aleppo. Friendly relations were not altogether broken off until the following year. Baldwin of Edessa spent the interval in dealing with the position of the Armenians on his western border. After a prolonged and bitter struggle the princedom founded by Basil kogh was completely destroyed and its principal towns were restored to the jurisdiction of EdessaI Pons ofTripolis seems to have carried on an active warfare with the Moslems, but his operations were on a minor scale. When Tugtakin visited Bagdad in the spring of 1116 he gave as a reason for the shortness of his visit the danger to which his territories were exposed^ Perhaps his relations with Tripolis caused him most anxiety. In the autumn of 1115 Pons captured Rafaniya and its Latin garrison became the scourge of the country round ; it was recaptured however within a month\\\\ In the early summer of 1116 Pons invaded the Bika' and posted himself at *Ain jar.

Early in 11 17 Lulu el-yaya was assassi- nated^ El-burski of Rahaba and Ilgazi of Maridin were two of several candidates for the vacant emirate. Ilgazi was actually in possession of the city for a short time. But his position was untenable owing to the distrust of the populace and the in- adequacy of the revenues which were available. El-burski was refused admission when he advanced to the gates with his supporter Tugtakin. He was menaced bythe Latins ofAntioch and retired. Ilgazi had also suffered from theirattacks. Rc^er received the fortress of El-kubba and other concessions in return for his services. After this the citizens welcomed Kirkhan of Homs as their protector and Tugtakin ravaged the territories of Homs in consequence^ The situation awakened the Latins to theiropportunity. Thedepredations ofthegarrison of El-kubba and the harshness with which the Latin dues were exacted brought matters to a crisis^ Roger was resolved to make war on the Moslem city. In the spring of 1118 the Moslem castle of Balatunus, on the hills to the east of Laodicea, was captured by the Latins after a siege which lasted from the 22nd of April to the 5th of May*. Roger and his ally Leo, an Armenian ruler in Cilicia, then laid siegeto 'Ezaz, which had been regained by the Moslems shortly after Tancred's death\\\". It lay somewhat north of Aleppo on the road between Antioch and Tell bashir. The citizens of Aleppo in great alarm sent for help to Tugtakin, but found him completely occupied in the hostilities which followed the death * Kem. iii. 610notlongbeforetheend ofa.H.510 (ending4th May 1117).

Later, however, this was still a Moslem stronghold (chap, in, p> 148, n. i). * There is no record of its recapture. It was however in Moslem hands in November 1114 (Kem. iii. 608) and possibly was gained in 1113 after Tancred's death.

He came at once but without sufficient troops to justify his attacking the Latin army. He offered Roger a large sum ofmoney on condition that he would raise the siege, but his offer was rejected. The garrison of'Ezaz then made terms for itself and surrendered the castle. Ilgazi purchased a general truce by further concessions. Arrears of tribute, due for four months,were paid and the fortress of Herak and some territory in the neighbourhood of Aleppo was surren- dered. Time was needed for warlike preparations. Ilgazi had a conference with Tugtakin of Damascus and arranged to co- operate with him in the followingsummer. Then he returned to Maridin to collect his forces. The sultan Mohammed was dead, having died on the i8th of April ofthis year(i118)^ but his son and successor Mahmud gave every support to Ilgazi's plans. In 1119 Ilgazi's power to assist Aleppo was put to a decisive test. The danger of the city was now extreme. The Latin* ravaged what territory it still possessed and captured Buza'a, to\\\\ the east towards the Euphrates^ The unfortunate Alepins urged Ilgazi not to delay his march to their assistance. He reached Aleppo in the first days of June^, having ravaged the' fields ofTell bashir on the way. Roger sent for help toTripolis and Jerusalem.

Ilgazi hesitated to make an attack before he was joined by Tugtakin. Finally however the impatience of his troops prevailed and he moved his position towards the Latin camp (27th June). The interval had given him time to mature his plans. On the morning of the 28th' he made his attack. The Latins had not realised how vulnerable their position was and were taken in a measure by surprise. They believed that the Moslem army lay in the direction of Atharib where there had been skirmishing the day before. But Ilgazi's troops poured into the valley from three sides at once'. Roger sent a detachment to hold off one of these divisions and drew up his main force beside the tents ofhis encampment. The battle was soon over. Almost at the first shock Roger's left wing broke and carried the right back in A confusion with it. dust-storm swept across the field of battle and completed the discomfiture ofthe Latins. The detachment at the entrance of the valley saved itself by flight. Roger was slain and 70 ofhis knights were captured*. The Moslems were jubilant over their victory. Ilgazi, it seems, permitted and encouraged the most cruel treatment oftheinferiorcaptives,who numbered about 500'. But he did not follow up his victory to any purpose. He allowed his forces to scatter in the accom- plishment ofminor undertakings. The Latins were terrified by the bands which scoured the country, but their fear was greater than their danger. Baldwin and Pons quickly appeared on the scene. Ilgazi sent troops to oppose their march but these were repulsed in the neighbourhood ofJabala.

For seven years the king of Jerusalem commanded the united armies of the Syrian Latins. Their battleground was northern Syria and the question to be decided was the fate ofAleppo. Ilgazi, it seems, was prevented from taking the field forthree weeks by fever (July)\\\\ After his recovery, having been joined by Tugtakin of Damascus, he laid siege to Atharib (beginning ofAugust).

III9-2O captures which he made' were Latin possessions and so must 1 recently have been lost. But as neither Atharib nor Zaredna were recovered Ilgazi had good cause to be satisfied with the fruits of his first campaign. He had loosened the strong hand from the throat of Aleppo and had gained a Moslem victory with which only one or two others could compare as yet in all the history ofthe struggle with the Latins. During Baldwin's campaign after the battle of Danith he was jomed by Joscelin of Tiberias'. Previous to 1113 Joscelin had been lord of Tell bashir'. Baldwin now conferred on him the lordship of the whole county of Edessa. There was need for such a bold leader on the northern borders, and since Baldwin's accession to the kingdom ofJerusalem heand Joscelin were again friends. Ilgazi's first movements in 1120 were in Joscelin's new territories. He commenced operations in the month of May. After four days spent in the neighbourhood of Edessa he crossed the Euphrates (26th May)* and ravaged the country between Tell bashir and Kaisun. Joscelin attacked the Moslems with some success but did not prevent them from entering the territories of Antioch. Passing by 'Ezaz, Ilgazi advanced on the town of Antioch. After a day spent in the vicinity he retired towards Kinnesrin. These fruitless move- ments produced discontent amongst his troops. There was not sufficient plunder to satisfy their wants and gratify their expec- tations and Ilgazi had no money to silence their murmurs. His Turkish horsemen began to melt away and only the arrival of Tugtakin with reinforcements enabled him to keep the field.

But Baldwin kept his men in close order and they resisted every temptation to break their ranks. They reached Ma'arat mesrin in safety and only one day later the Moslems retired to Aleppo^ Having thus cleared the country the Latins returned to Antioch. Peace was made until March of the following year^. All this took place before the end of June. In the same month Ilgazi destroyed Zaredna that it might not fall into the hands of the enemy^ Joscelin, it appears, did not consider himself bound by the truce which Baldwin had made. Early in 1121 he cruelly raided the district of El-ahass^ and later the district in the neighbourhood of Buza'a. Ilgazi's governor in Aleppo was obliged to make separate terms with him. About the same time the territory of Shaizar was attacked by the Latins of Antioch and its emir bought a short truce by a payment of moneys When the truce with Aleppo expired the attacks on its territory were resumed. Atharib was twice attacked with a month's interval between, and Aleppo itself was menaced Affairs in Maridin detained Ilgazi in the east and he sent orders that peace should be made on whatever terms the Latins demanded. In 1120 the Latin title to some of the districts taken from them in 1119 had been acknowledged now further ; concessions were made. It was even arranged thatthey should have possession of Atharib, but the garrison refused to hand it over. Not long afterwards Ilgazi's son Sulaiman, governor of Aleppo, revolted against his father. The Latins utilised their opportunitytore-occupyandfortifyZaredna(August-September 1121). Several less important castles which the Moslems held were invested and also captured.

Sulaiman submitted to him and he entered Aleppo on the 13th of November. He remained in Syria four months. During that time a temporary peace was made with the Latins and the lands which had been theirs when they held Atharib and Zaredna were again surrendered to them^ Ilgazi returned to Syria at the end ofJune 1122 in order to resume the Latin war. He was accompanied byhis nephew Nur ed-daula Balak and was joined again by Tugtakin. Zaredna was besieged on the 27th of July. Baldwin was in Tripolis enforcing his authorityas Pons' overlord. When he approached at the head of a relief force, Ilgazi withdrew from the castle. The siege had lasted only a fortnight. The Latins avoided battle with Ilgazi and a number of indecisive movements followed. Finally the illness which resulted in Ilgazi's death attacked him, and in consequence the Moslem army broke up. Ilgazi withdrew to Aleppo and Tugtakin to Damascus^ Balak's emirate was near Malatiya and he also started homewards. On the way a piece of great good fortune befel him. He was pursued and overtaken by Joscelin. Balak's force was superior' and besides he was posted in a spot guarded by marshes. It was folly for the Latins to attack him in these circumstances, but they did so. Their horses sank in the mire, the arrows of the enemy rained upon them and their only safety lay in flight. Joscelin was taken prisoner and from 25 to 60 ofhis companions with him (13th September)*. Balak shut up his prisoners in the castle of Khartbart. By his fortunate capture he marked himselfout as the successor of his dying uncle, Ilgazi ibn Ortok. ' Kem. iii.635-631. ' Kem.iii.631ffm. andFulcheriii. 11.

His government of Aleppo (1118-1122) marks an important stage in the history of the Latin war. Being ruler of both Maridin and Aleppo he drew the relations between Syria and Mesopotamia much closer than Maudud had left them. The capital of northern Syria in the hands of a Mesopotamian emir was no longer isolated and dependent on the hazard of chance alliances. Ilgazi's career itself proved the advantage of its new relations. The Latin occupation of the country received its first rude shock from the blows which he delivered. A new hope and the promise of a better future dawned on the inhabitants of Aleppo. Baldwin heard the news of Joscelin's capture at Tripolis on his way home\\\\ and returned at once to Antioch. The season did not permit of serious operations, but throughout the winter and especially after Ilgazi's death the Latins made constant attacks on the territory of Aleppol The governor for the time was Badr ed-daula, also a nephew of Ilgazi. On the 9th of April (1123) he surrendered Atharib and made peace with the Latins. Forthwith Baldwin set out to attack Balak, who was besieging the castle of Karkar. Once more the Moslems gained a notable success (i8th April)^ Baldwin was surprised, taken captive and imprisoned along with Joscelin in Khartbart. After the capture of Karkar, a week later, Balak set out for Syria to secure Aleppo. The town was captured, after a brief resistance, on the 26th of June^ and the citadel surrendered three days later. Balak strengthened his position by marrying one of Rudwan's daughters.

He besieged and captured El-bara and then attacked Kafr tab. While so engaged news reached him (6th August)* that his prisoners, the Latin princes, had escaped. In fact a band ofsome fifteen Armenians*,indisguiseand poorly dressed,having gained admission to Khartbarton some pretext', had killed the soldiers of the guard and liberated the prisoners from the tower in which they were confined. Rescuers and rescued were then joined by those of the inhabitants who were Christians and the citadel was captured. Baldwin decided to remain in Khartbart while Joscelin went to Jerusalem for ^assistance. But Balak acted more swiftly than his opponents. In a fortnight* he appeared before the walls; on the i6th of September' the defenders were overpowered. The heroic rescuers and many of the Latins were put to death. Baldwin ^was again a prisoner. When Joscelin learned that Khartbart had been captured he employed the troops he had raised in cruellywastingthecountry round Aleppo. Even trees were cut down and graves profaned. In retaliation, about this time, the kadi of Aleppo transformed the cathedral and two other churches into mosques. Two churches still remained for the use of the Christian inhabitants. Joscelin's army dispersed shortly after the 23rd ofOctober^ but afterwards in November and still later he and the troops of Edessa continued to raid and harry the country'. About the middle of January (1124) Balak returned to Aleppo.

It was indeed a serious blow to the Moslem cause, as events quickly showed. Balak's successor in Aleppo was Timurtash, Ilgazi's son, who proved quite incompetent. He committed a serious error to begin with, when he released Baldwin of Jerusalem. On the 24th of June^ it was arranged' that the king should pay a ransom for his liberty and surrender, also, the fortress of 'Ezaz^ Two months passed, during which certain hostages were given up and part payment of the ransom was made. Then Baldwin was released (on the 29thofAugust)''. No sooner did he reach Antioch than he announced that he did not intend to keep his promise (6th September)''. The patriarch absolved him from his oath and bade him not keep faith with infidels.

There were 300 tents in the besiegers' camp and one-third of the troops were Moslems. The attack and defence were exceptionally bitter. The town was reduced to the utmost extremity by the scarcity of provisions and the prevalence of disease. The inhabitants were forced to use dogs and carcasses for their food. Timurtash was in Maridin and gave scant attention to the entreaties of the deputies who implored his assistance\\\". Fortunately their next appeal was directed to one of a different stamp. Aksonkor el-burski was recovering the position of which he had been deprived by the predominance of the Ortoks for so many years. Since May 1121^ he had been ruler of Mosul, for the second time. He readily promised his help and quickly made his preparations. He reached Aleppo after nightfall on Thursday the 29th of January (1125)-'. The besiegers acknowledged their discomfiture by beating a hasty retreat. So ended the only regular siege of Aleppo which the Latins ever undertook. It lasted four months and was the climax of the danger to which the city had been exposed for many years. When El-burski arrived the last extremity had been reached. The walls were manned by men who rose from sick beds when the enemy attacked. Aleppo was saved by the successor of Maudud and the army of Mosul.

Duringtheearlypart ofthe reign ofBaldwin II the situation in Jerusalem was similar to what it had been in the latter part ofthe reign ofhis predecessor. The attacks from Egypt ceased altogether and those of Damascus were purely incidental and insignificant (1119-1121)1 The assassination of El-afdal (5th December 1121)2 made no immediate difference in the policy of the former country. The Latins, having secured their position, did not meantime seek to extend their borders. The Moslems, having ascertained their opponents' strength, were disposed to acquiesce in the Latin occupation. Nevertheless neither the Syrian Latins nor the western pilgrims enjoyed in Palestine in these years the security ofa settled country. The real situation is disclosed by the early history of the \\\"poor knights of Christ,\\\" afterwards called the knights Templars, from their place of residence in the temple area at Jerusalem. The roads from the coast to the holy places were infested by Arabs whose de- predations were made easier by the Moslem inhabitants of the country. In these circumstances, in 1119, Hugh de Payns and seven other knights vowed to devotetheir lives to the protection of pilgrims and travellers in the holy land. They conformed to the practice ofthe regular orders by professing poverty, chastity and obedience. When the council ofTroyes formallysanctioned the order and gave it a rule (1128) the knights still numbered only nine, and no great change had taken place in the character and service of the order. From the summer of 1122 until April 1x25 Baldwin was continuously absent from his kingdom and for a considerable part of that time he was a prisoner. After his capture (April ^ Fulcheriii.40.

II23 1123) a council was held at 'Akka and Eustace of Caesarea and Sidon was elected regent. About the same time El-mamum, the new ruler of Egypt, resolved to attack Jaffa. He was urged by Tugtakin and Aksonkor to make use of his opportunity^ He sent troops by land to Jaffa and a fleet of some forty ships' to co-operate by sea. The fleet arrived in Ascalon about the middle of May. Jaffa was vigorously attacked and having only a small garrison was in great danger. But when Eustace appeared with the army ofJerusalem, after five or six days', the Egyptians did not await his onset. They were pursued and overtaken at Yabna* and again fled shamefully before they were attacked. Many were killed in their flight and the Moslem camp and large spoil fell to the victor (30thMay 1123)'. Three days later a Venetian fleet arrived in 'Akka with the Doge on board. He was informed of what had just occurred and sailed at once to Ascalon where the Egyptian fleet now lay. The Moslems were surprised before dawn one morning, lying unsuspiciously at anchor. At the first onset their admiral's ship was sunk and after a brief resistance those still able to save themselves made off. Fourgalleys, four \\\"cats\\\" and a merchant ship were captured. Before the Venetians returned to 'Akka they captured also ten richly laden merchantmen off the Egyptian coast*. On the 15th of June Eustace died and William de Buris of Tiberias was appointed his successor. In August an expedition was sent with Joscelin to assist Baldwin to escape from Khartbart. When the army reached Tell bashir, news was received that he was again a prisoner, now in Harran.

He occupied the town of Horns for a time, but failed to dislodge Kirkhan from the citadel. Mahmud of Hama died and later on Tugtakin took possession ofthat town^ The Venetian crusade of 1123 was in response to an appeal of Baldwin's sent to Italy some time previously. During the winter which followed their arrival,after considerable discussion, an agreement was drawn out embodying the conditions on which they were willing to assist the Latins of Jerusalem. It was decided that Ascalon or Tyre should be besieged, and Tyre was chosen by lot. The city was still nominally an Egyptian dependency, but Tugtakin had already acted as its protector'', and now again garrisoned and provisioned it to withstand this fresh attack. The troops which he sent were the main stay of its defence, apart from its situation and fortifications. Tyre lay on what was practically an island, although joined to the main- land by a narrow causewayabout a bowshot in breadth. Round the whole circumference ran a double wall crowned by towers at intervals ; on the eastern side, towards the land, were three successive walls. The Latins reached the city on the 15th of February 1124^ Their first care was to build a rampart across the causeway, from north to south, to protect them from the town. Siege engines of every kind were constructed in large numbers. Two towers were built, one by the Syrian Latins, the other by the Venetians. Only one ship was left afloat to watch the entrance ofthe harbour, the rest were beached. The huge stones which were shot into the town shook the walls and towers and crashed into the dwelling houses of the people. But the defenderswerewell equipped with powerful engines also and their well-directed fire made the task ofthe Latin engineers most perilous. There were constant engagements on the causewaywhich divided the contending parties,but the besiegers gained no ground. Once Tugtakin advanced to the neighbour- hood of the town and there were rumours that an Egyptian 1 I.A.i. 354f. (inA.H. 517 whichcommences 23rd March 1123).

But Tugtakin withdrew when the Latins prepared to attack him, and not a single ship came from Egypt. Two insignificant raids from Ascalonwere theonly signs that the Egyptians took any interest in the beleaguered town. Seeing there was no help from the outside the task of the besiegers was simply to starve the town into surrender. Gradually the defence slackened. The greatest triumphs of the garrison wereslight and unsubstantial. When theguardship was towed into the harbour by bold swimmers from the city it was replaced by another. On the 21st ofJune* an unexpected sally from the town resulted in the destruction of one of the most powerful of the Latin engines. But the skill of an Armenian engineer from Antioch put fresh life into the besiegers and Tugtakin counselled surrender. It was he who arranged the terms. The citizens were allowed either to depart in freedom, takingwith them their moveable possessions,or to remain in the enjoyment ofall their property subject to a fixed poll tax. The city surrendered on the 7th of July (1124)='. Some complained that such awealthy town should not escape beingplundered, but the Latin chiefs kept faith. TheVenetians were given one-third ofthe city, as had been agreed previously. The occupation of Aleppo by El-burski (January 1 125) and the failure of the Latin siege must have brought profound relief to Tugtakin after the death of Balak and the issue of the siege of Tyre. El-burski proved a worthy successor to Balak and Ilgazi. He won the Alepins by his justice and his wise govern- ment, and both Tugtakin and Kirkhan of Homs were his allies. Baldwin had not long been back in Jerusalem when he learned that El-burski had commenced his summer campaign (1125), Kafr tab was captured on the 8th of May' and 'Ezaz was then ' Fulcheriii.31 (xiKal.

It was in great peril when Baldwin's army arrived on A the scene. battle was fought on the nth of June^ By a feigned retreat the Latins threw El-burski off his guard and gained a complete victory. This on the one side, and on the other the king's desire to recover the hostages he had given at the time of his release, prepared the way for an armistice. The Latin captives were released for a ransom ^ and it was agreed that the revenues of Jebel summak and the other territories in dispute should be divided. It appears that the Latins did not permit the Moslem tax-gatherers to collect their share of the revenue, but there was no further war until next summer. Baldwin seems to have remained in the north until September^ In October he built a castle on the hills beside Beirut, six miles from the town (mons Glavianus), so as to compel the natives to contribute to the Latin revenues^ War was then declared on Tugtakin and a successful raid was made into his territories. When the king returned from this excursion he led the same forces straight to Ascalon, where a fresh garrison had just been stationed. The Moslems sallied out and were repulsed with the loss of forty men. Preparations were then made for a more serious expedition against the territories of Damascus. The Latins crossed the Jordan on the 13th of January (1126)*. They passed through the wadi Rahub and marched slowly north through the territories of Damascus. On the 23rd of January they reached the traditional scene of St Paul's vision. Tugtakin's army appeared in sight next day.

The outer defences of Atharib had fallen when Baldwin and Joscelin advanced to its relief, but El-burski retired without risking an engagement. He was joined by Tugtakin and a period of fruitless negotiation with the Latins followed. About the first week of August^ both parties withdrew. Tugtakin fell ill and returnedtoDamascusand El-burskito Mosul. El-burski's career was already ended.

The garrison of Beirut set upon the landing party and inflicted on it a sharp reversed Towards the close of II26 Bohemond II landed in Antioch and was received with the greatest rejoicing(October-November)'*. He was only a youth of eighteen, but affable and gallant and princely in his bearing. He was welcomed by his subjects for his father's sake, and Baldwin laid aside with equal gladness the burden of administering the northern princedom. The young prince married Baldwin's second daughter, Alice, and in the spring of 1127 his brief career opened auspiciously with the siege and recovery of Kafr tab^ Unfortunately a quarrel with Joscelin ensued. The old hero may not have found it easy to become the vassal ofonewho is described as still in fact a beardless boy.

'IMAD ED-DIN ZANKI. Like the days of the Norman conquest in our own land the period oftheTurkish conquest of Syriawas pre-eminentlyatime when noble or princely houses were founded. Zanki's father, Kasim ed-daula Aksonkor^ won his reputation in the armies of Malik Shah and the emirate of Aleppo was his reward. He ruled there ten years until 1094, when he lost his life in the contests for the vacant sultanate. The feature of his character which stands out mostclearlyis a certain ruthless strengthwhich never spared a dangerous foe and carried him out to his own execution as ifhe himself had given the order. Thesame spirit lived again in Zanki when he was ruler. But meantime others seized Aleppo, forat his father's death Zanki was a boy only ten years of ageI ^ About this sametime, a little later, Kiwam ed-daula Kerboga became ruler of Mosul. He had been a companion in arms of Aksonkor and for the memory of this friendship took Zanki under his protection. Thus Mosul became the place of Zanki's education and early training. From its rulers he learned lessons of success and failure in the conduct of a state. He remained resident in the town even after Kerboga's death in 1102'. Before Maudud's accession (i108) he had distinguished himself by his bravery and capacity. He shared in that prince's campaigns against the Latins and was much esteemed by him. ^ Tobedistinguished fromAksonkorel-burski. ^ A.S.

IIII-27 The Arabic historians delight to point out that his talents were thus early devoted to the jifiad or holy war. In the expedition of 1111 he remained with Maudud through the whole campaign. In 1113 he signalised himself by his daring at the siege of Tiberias. In 1 114 he served under El-burski, then for the first time ruler of Mosul. Whateverthepart he played under Mas'ud andhisatabekJuyush Beg in theinterval until El-burski'srestora- tion in 1121^ he lost by it neither the favour of El-burski nor that of the sultan Mahmud'. It was under the patronage of these latter that he entered on the career which established his fortune. In 1122 the sultan called El-burski to his help against the Arab chief Dubais ibn Sadaka and appointed him viceroy of the province of 'Irak. Zanki rendered signal service in the contest which followed and was rewarded with the dependency of Wasit and the prefecture of Basra. He recognised in the promotion a stepping-stone to independence and resolved to quit El-burski's service for that ofthesultan. After the decisive battle in March 1123 he refused to return to Mosul. During the contests between the caliph and the sultan in 1125-26 Zanki was the instrument of Mahmud's success and rose yet higher in his favour. His appointment to the important and difficult post of prefect of Bagdad and of all 'Irak was a testimony to the confidence of the sultan in his high ability. In the autumn of 1127 the emirate of Mosul was rendered vacant, for the second time within a year, by the death of El- burski's son and successor. No position could have attracted Zanki more. In Bagdad he was overshadowed by the sultan. In Mosul he was already known and esteemed, and nowhere had he less to learn of the policy which the situation demanded. It was therefore not an accident which led to the suggestion that he should be appointed atabek there, norwas there anycandidate whom the sultan might reasonably prefer'. Upper Mesopotamia was a.ssigned him as his province, along with Mosul. * SeeWeiliii. 114-119. ^ A.S.Cairo 19. ' Jawali, amamlukof El-burski's, issaid tohavesentenvoysto the sultanon his own behalf.

But the considerations notedabove forbid us to adopt Weil's summarystatement that Zanki owed his nomination \\\"simply to the readiness of the envoys to accept a bribe\\\" (iii. 147). The bribery had its effect but was not everything.127\",\"A.D. 1127-46 'IMAD ED-DIN ZANKI I23 'Imad ed-din Zanki in his new position was destined far to surpass the achievements of his predecessors. His career had already marked him as one well capable of consolidating the power placed in his hands. He possessed most of the qualities of a good soldier and capable ruler. He was a man of clear purpose, which is the first condition of success, and swift in the execution of his plans. He was unscrupulous and cruel in his treatment of enemies but his friends and subjects were the gainers. He was feared doubtless more than loved yet his ; soldiers were attached to him, for he shrank from no danger and he made their interests his own. The power he gained was to the advantage ofhis people, for he sought to establish order and security in the states he governed. The even-handed justice which he administered is the mark of a strong ruler in the East. His conception of a state may still be read in his own words ; it is \\\"a garden surrounded by a hedge into which those who are outside fear to enters\\\" Syria was not included in Zanki's sphere of influence by the sultan's grant. But Zanki did not allow this to set a bound to his schemes. He acted as ifAleppo was his rightful inheritance. He aimed from the first, without doubt, at establishing his sway over the whole of Moslem Syria. In this he followed the example of his predecessors. But a survey of his career brings to light a marked difference between his policyand theirs. The conquests he chiefly aimed atwere from Moslem rivals. It must be concluded that he deliberately abstained from attack on the Latin states. While he built up his power he desired to be free from the risks of serious war with them. During a period of eight years, from the time he became ruler of Mosul, he invaded Latin territory only once. This invasion of Antioch in 11 30 was a passing incident,called forth byspecial circumstances and ofbriefduration. The soldiers of Aleppo and Zanki's governor were indeed constantly engaged in border warfare with the Latins of Antioch. But the campaigns of the atabek in Syria were invariably directed in the first place and chiefly against Damascus and its dependencies. Zanki strained every effort to conquer Damascus; it is unlikely that the overthrow of the ^ I.A.ii. 142.128\",\"124 'IMAD ED-DIN ZANKI A.D.I1 27-28 Latin states was any part of his policy. Only once before his famous capture of Edessa did he seriously take the aggressive against the Latins. It was in the year 1135, to secure a tract of country just beside Aleppo. The significance of Zanki's reign in its relation to the Latins lies in the fact that he erected a barrier against their progress and forged a weapon for their destruction. His attackoj}.

It seems^hat he himself regarded it as a de- parture from his own policy, undertaken at the instigation of another^ It may be observed that Ibn el-athir leaves the impression that thejihad occupied a greater place in Zanki's career than it really did. He singles out for emphasiseveryexpedition against the \\\"infidels\\\" and every victory over them, because these appeared to him the most glorious incidents in the atabek's career. As panegyrist of the rulers of Mosul he had a special reason for exalting their services in the holy war, that they might not seem to come short of the achievements of Saladin, thesupplanterofZanki'shouse. An error in chronology' contributed to place the events of Zanki's first Syrian campaign in a false perspective. It was natural to think of the conqueror of Edessa as one devoted to thejihad throughout his whole career. Promptitude and energy mark every step of Zanki's first movements as ruler of Mosul. The sultan's grant was little else than a strong man's opportunity and as such Zanki used it. Without delay he secured the country north and west of Mosul. The Ortok princes were his most formidable rivals. Even they made outward submission within a few months, before the close of the year 1127. In the beginning of 1128 Zanki's troops occupied Aleppo, to the reliefand satisfaction ofthe inhabitants. It was some months before they were followed by the atabek himself.

Somewhat late next year, in 1129^ Zanki returned to Syria. His intention was to occupy the towns between Aleppo and Damascus. With this object in view he wrote to the emir of Damascus proposing an alliance against the Latins.

Damascus was a buffer state on the fate ofwhich much depended. It was sufficient for the Latinsof Jerusalem that it should remain independent and that its power should not be cast on the side of the emir of northern Syria. But their most natural policy was to seek its conquest. All Palestine except Ascalon was now occupied. If Jerusalem was to extend its boundaries the next stage was the conquest of Damascus. Throughout Baldwin's reign it had been a trouble- some enemy both in north and south, so that all the Latin states were directly interested in such an enterprise. The death of Tugtakin (February 1128) does not seem to have produced any immediate movement on the Latin side. In the following April Baldwin wasted the country round Ascalon^ and in thecourseof theyeara castlenear Sidonwas besieged bythepatriarch*. Plans were however being made, the execution of which depended on the anticipated arrival of reinforcements from Europe. After the order of the knights of the Temple had been sanctioned by the council of Troyes (January 1128) its master, Hugh de Payns, traversed England, Scotland and France seeking recruits for the order and for a new crusade. He returned to Palestine in 1129, accompanied by a large and distinguished band of knights, and the projected attack on Damascus was made in Novemberofthatyear. Possiblytheexpedition wasdisastrously hastened by a train of circumstances whose starting-point goes back to the year 1126. In that year Banyas was given by Tug- takin into the charge of an Ismailian^ leader and the doctrines of the sect gained a footing in Damascus. He was killed in battle in 1128, but Banyas continued in possession of one of his followers. In 1129 this emir and others of the sect in Damascus plotted to surrender the city to the Latins. The plot was discovered at the commencement of September and the leaders in Damascus were put to death. It is not clear whether Bald- win'sfinal preparations fortheexpeditionhadalreadycommenced or whether they were precipitated in consequence of the mis- 1 Rev. Or.

Although it was the latter part of Novemb^r^ the Latins resolved to advance on Damascus. They seem to have counted on the treachery of confederates within the city or to have been unwilling to disperse their forces without some em- ployment of their strength. They encamped near Damascus but only for a very short time. A large part ofthe army set off one day to strip the country of supplies. Horsemen from the city followed them the Latins were overtaken in the Marj ; suffar, about 38 miles south-west of Damascus, and severely defeated (5th December)^ Justat this momenttherainsofwinter commenced. There were violent thunderstorms and a downfall ofsnow. In such circumstances a siege was out of the question and the Latins returned home. Theirexpedition had been a most discouraging failure, although its issue might have been foreseen. Banyas however remained in their possession and was an impor- tant gain. The town lies at the head of the Jordan valley and commands the country as far as Hule and Tiberias. Its occupa- tion gavesecurityto adistrictwhich could noteasily be protected solongas Banyas remained a Moslem stronghold, Buri did not attempt its recovery. The policy of Damascus during his reign was altogether insignificant. He died two and a halfyears later on the 6th of June II32^ of wounds received in the preceding year. Until then the Latins made no further movement against Damascus. In the year 1130 unexpected events took place in Antioch. There was almost civil war within its borders and a situation was created which left Antioch without an effective leader for someyearsto come. The discord began with Bohemond's death. ' After the 15th (I.A. i. 385). Bohemond's capture of the castle of Kadmus in theJebel Ansariyain A.H. 523 (I.A. i. 387) maybe dated earlier in this year.

Shortly after Baldwin's death Joscelin of Edessa died of injuries which he had received while besieging a Moslem castle in the previous year\\\\ He was succeeded by Joscelin II, whose mother was a sister ofthe Armenian prince Leo. The.niew king of Jerusalem was Fulk of Anjou, grandfather of Henry II of England. He was Baldwin's son-in-law and heir by the king's choice. He married Baldwin's daughter Melisend in May 1129^. Immediately after his accession to the throne ofJerusalem Alice revived her claim to Antioch. She was supported by Pons of Tripolis and by Joscelin II of Edessa. Fulk maintained his predecessor's policy and occupied Antioch as the protector of Constance. Pons established himself in Er-ruj and harassed the king's party until he was attacked and severely defeated^ Peace was then happily restored and the king remained in Antioch for some time setting its affairs in order (1132?). During his stay a band ofmarauding Turkomans, who attacked Ma'arat mesrin and Kafr tab, were successfully repulsed^ Before the end of 1132 Fulk had troubles of his own in Jerusalem. He was obliged to take the field against one of his vassals, Hugh of Jaffa. The conflict was not in itself serious but it gave the new ruler of Damascus, Shams el-muluk Isma*il an opportunitytorecoverBanyas (1 5th December 11 32)'. Just at the same critical moment news cameto the kingthat his presence was urgently required in the north. Pons of Tripolis had been ^ Tyrexiv. 3; cf.

He raised the siege and drove offthe enemy-. He also took part in an expedition shortly afterwards from Antioch against Sawar of Aleppo. Sawar was defeated near Kinnesrin in the beginning of January 1133'. Before Fulk returned to Jerusalem it was decided to invite Raymond of Poitou to be prince of Antioch*. He was a noble at the court of Henry I of England and readily accepted the invitation. But he did not arrive in Syria until the year 1136. Shams el-muluk's capture of Banyas in December 1132 was the commencement of a career of promise which was soon cut off. Hama was surrendered to him on the 6th of August 1133, after two days attack, and Shaizar then became tributary\\\". In September Shams el-muluk was in Damascus. Two months later he captured Shakif tirun, a fortress in the district of Sidon. Its occupant had been an enemy both to Moslems and to Christians\\\". All this activity now stirred the Latins into action. In 1134 Fulk invaded the Hauran. Shams el-muluk caused his retreat by a counter invasion of the territories of JerusaIem^ It is not clear what his general policy towards the Latins would have been had he lived.

Neither castles nor towns seem to have been lost or gained on either side. Very different is the record of Zanki's achievements in the spring of 1135. He resolved to attack those Latin strongholds which still lay in the very neighbourhood of Aleppo. His briefcampaign was a triuniphal progress. The Latins were taken by surprise and no army resisted his operations. _Atharib fell first. It was captured on the 17th of April'. Other successes followed in quick succession. Zaredna made no serious resistance. Ma'arat en-nu*man, Kafr tab^ and all thecountry between Aleppo and Hama w^as restored to the Moslem faith. It was Zanki's first campaign against the Latins and was conspicuously successful*\\\\ From these conquests Zanki turned to an attack on Homs. After a feiiit on Barin he swiftly approached the city. While he was laying waste the neighbourhood news reached him that a Latin army had taken the field at last. It was commanded by Pons of Tripolis* and doubtless included the forces both of Antioch and of Tripolis. Zanki advanced towards Kinnesrin, where the Latins were, and drove them off, easily it seems. Then he returned to Homs and for ten days in the beginning of August occupied himself in burning the fields round about and in delivering attacks on the city*. Immediately afterwards Zanki left Syria, for his presence was urgently required in Mosul and Bagdad. For more than another year he was involved in the wars of the sultan and the caliph. But the weakness ofAntioch had been laid bare by the events of the summer. Zanki's lieutenant Sawar took the lesson to heart. In 1136 Antioch suffered an invasion unparalleled in its previous history. Sawar carried fire and sword across the principality to Laodicea, on the coast. A hundred villages were given to the flames'. The plunder of Laodicea itself was only part ofthe rich booty brought back to Aleppo. ^ ist Rajab 519(Kem. iii. 670). '^ Kern. iii. 671.

Two parties intrigued for supremacy in the princedom. Bohemond's wife AHce was nominal ruler at last. Fulk was persuaded by her sister, hiswife Melisend, to abstain from interference^ The party which .. supported Constance awaited the arrival of Raymond of Poitou. The patriarch craftily persuaded Alice that Raymond might become her husband. In these circumstances there was no one in Antioch to take the lead against Zanki nor was there mutual confidence between the contending parties in the divided city. Fulk of Jerusalem was the one hope of the situation and might have come to the rescue. Possibly he regarded himself as no longer responsible because of his agreement with Alice. The simplest way of acting on it was to abstain from all interference in the affairs of the north. His presence in Antioch for any purpose was sure to produce complications. At the same time Fulk's inactivity may also be viewed as the triumph of a new policy in the south. Even in Baldwin's lifetime there was a. party which complained that the king wasted the strength of Jerusalem and endangered thesafetyofthe Holy Crossin remote and perilous enterprisesI He seemed neglectful of his proper kingdom in his zeal for the interests of the north. It was Bald- win's experience as ruler of Edessa which influenced his policy. He knew the danger which threatened the northern states from Mosul and Aleppo, and he understood how the interests of, Jerusalem were at stake in the issue of the struggle. Fulk had not the same grasp of the situation nor the same wide outlook. He was the first of the kings of Jerusalem to be trained in an atmosphere of\\\" separatism.\\\" The others had shared in a com- mon cause and learned that the suffering and success of one member affected all theother members too. Fulk neither under- stood the true interests of Jerusalem nor realised the gravity of the situation in the north. The Moslems were left to deal with Antioch and Edessa. Tripolis was a dependency of Jeru- salem and continued to receive assistance from it. Fulk has also been charged with incapacity and weakness of ^ Tyrexiv. 20. 2 Cf. Fulcher iii. 9.140\",\"136 THE KNIGHTS HOSPITALLERS A.D.I 36 1 character^ This estimate of him is founded on certain state- ments made by William of Tyre. He is represented as more than sixtyyears ofage,a worn out man, with his memoryalmost gone, controlled by favourites. In reality when Fulk became king he was about forty years old he was deliberately chosen ; by Baldwin and his councillors as a fit successor and he justified the choice by frequent displays ofdecision and energy. It may be said,even, that in his reign the kingdom ofJerusalem enjoyed its period of greatest prosperity. It was Fulk's northern policy, not his general ability, which was at fault. William of Tyre is not to be relied on in justification ofthe contrary view*. In Jerusalem the garrison ofAscalon was again active in its depredations during the years 1132-36'. Emboldened by frequent successes and continually reinforced from Egypt it was a standing menace on the borders. To guard the road from Jaffa to Jerusalem a castle was fortified at Bait nuba early in 1133. Later a scheme of planting castles at intervals round the city, within an 8-12 miles radius, was adopted. In pursuance ofthis plan a fortress was erected at Bait Jibrin (Jibelin) in 1136. It was situated on the edge of the plain at the foot of the hills eastofAscalon, twelve miles away. The village and the district were the property of the hospital of St John in Jerusalem and the fortress was accordinglycommitted to the care ofthe Master and brethren of that order. This was the beginning of the territorial influence ofthe knights Hospitallers in the neighbour- hood of Ascalon and is also the first known instance of their activity as a military order. Since the capture of Jerusalem by the Latins they had been zealous as a brotherhood devoted to the nursing of the sick and to works of charity*.

The transition was made under the guidance of thesecond Master,Raymonddu Puy(i 1 20-1160). Itissignificant that from the first in their new capacity the protection of the i.atin borders was their special duty. It was on the borders that the service of the military orders was most required, and as their wealth increased and their organisation was perfected they became the most efficient defenders of the Holy Land. Mean- time from 11 36 the knights of Bait Jibrin effectively checked the raids ofthe garrison ofAscalon. The year 1137 was an eventful one in Syria. In the early part ofthe year the army of Damascus under Bazwash^ invaded Tripolis,encouraged,doubtless,bythesuccessofSawar's invasion of Antioch in 1136. In March^ a battle was fought in which Pons was defeated. He fled amongst the hills of Lebanon, was captured by the inhabitants and putto death. His son Raymond succeeded him and at once took what revenge he could on the dwellers amongst thehills. They were even suspected ofhaving invited Bazwash to undertake his expedition. After this Zanki returned to Syria. He reached Aleppo on the 15th ofJune. True to his former policy he at once renewed the siege of Homsl Mu'in ed-din Anar was governor of the city^ Afternegotiations and attacks which occupied some three weeks Zanki relinquished his attempt (nth July)^ and turned away to the siege of the Latin castle of Barin. Raymond of Tripolis was joined by Fulk in an effort to raise the siege. Zanki heard of their approach and surprised the Latins on the march,entangled in the hills. Raymond was taken prisoner and Fulk took refuge in Barin, where he now became one of the besieged.

II37 investment soon reduced its defenders to serious straits. The approach ofanother relieffdrceTnduced Zanki to offer favourable terms of surrender. They were accepted by the garrison, who did not know that help was close at hand. Free exit was allowed to those in the castle and the prisoners taken in the recent battle were released. This was in the third week of August^ The relieving army dispersed when the news reached them ; it had been commanded by Raymond ofAntioch. Barin was an important capture, for its garrison had been a scourge to the Moslems of the plain which stretches towards Horns and Hama. While Moslems and Latinswere thus engaged a Greek army was on the point of entering Syria. The interference of the Greeks once more in the affairs of the Latin states is the most novel feature in the history of the year 1137. The emperor John had greatly strengthened the position of the empire in Asia Minor. In Cilicia this brought him into rivalry with the Latins of Antioch and with Leo the Armenian. After Bohe- mond's death a proposal was made that a son of his should marry Constance and become prince of Antioch. The emperor was much aggrieved when Raymond of Poitou was preferred. It was probably in the latter part of 1 136 that Raymond arrived in Antioch and married the child Constance. Alice was com- pelled to resign her position and Raymond took the reins of government. This settlement ofaffairs was one cause which led the emperor to invade Cilicia in the summer of 1137. The expedition was directed also in part againstthe Armenian prince Leo'. The Greek army reduced the principal towns of Cilicia, made a prisoner of the Armenian prince and then advanced against Antioch. News of this advance brought Raymond hurriedly back from his expedition to the relief of Barin'. Wm ^ In the last ten daysofDhu'l-ka'da, i.e. 10-19 August (Kem. iii.673).

Tyre xiv. 26 may be understood to say that hewascloseat hand {proforibus). It isincrediblethat Antioch wasalreadyinvested. According to an Armenian chronicle the emperor encamped before Antioch on the143\",\"A.D.I137 GREEK INVASION OF SYRIA 139 Antioch was bombarded for some days by the emperor's siege engines and then Raymond judged it prudent to yield. The terms imposed were that he should swear allegiance to the emperor and hold Antioch as a fief, and, further, that as soon as Aleppo, Shaizar, Hama and Homs were conquered and handed over to him he should surrender Antioch entirely. One cannot suppose that these terms were agreeable to Raymond. Perhaps he and his advisers were influenced by the conviction that the Moslem towns, for which hewas to exchange Antioch, could not becaptured. Itwas agreed that there should be a joint campaign against them next summer. Meantime the emperor, having re- ceived Raymond's oathoffealty and seen his banner planted on the citadel of Antioch, returned to Cilicia to spend the winter. The agreement was made about the beginning of September^ After this Zanki resumed his campaign against the depen- dencies ofDamascus. The presence of the Greek army did not affect his plans. An embassy from the emperor, shortly after the loth of September^ conveyed, no doubt, what appeared to be satisfactory assurances^ The departure of the Greeks to Cilicia was reassuring. There was no evidence that those who had acted this summer as Raymond's enemies would return next year to be his allies. Bazwash of Damascus on the other hand had recently given proofs ofan energy and activity which might bedangerous. Zanki accordingly resolved tostrike more directly at his territories. About the middle of October, after an attack on Horns, he started southward. He threatened Ba'albek as he passed and swept through the Bika*. He captured the fortress of'Ain jar at its southern extremityand received thesubmission of the governor of Banyas.

The town lies on a formidable rocky ridge which is defended on one side by the Orontes. It was the possession of an independent emir. The siege lasted twenty- four days. Sjeveral times the emperor's troops penetrated the lower part of the town. But the castle at the head of the rock defied his efforts. It was a fortnight before the siege engines were got ready. They played ineffectually on the walls for ten days and then the siege was broken up (21st May)^. This decision was the emperor's and was no doubt chiefly due to the slackness of his allies and their failure to co-operate with him^ The whole scheme, of which the siege of Shaizar was a part, must now have seemed hopeless. Zanki's resistance was still in reserve. A Turkish army had been gathered by the orders of the sultan and had crossed the Euphrates'*. The Moslems of Iconium were invading Cilicia^ The allies were not united. Raymond is not likely to have been zealous to gain any of the towns whose conquest involved his surrender of Antioch. The emperor, accordingly, accepted a promise of tribute from the emir of Shaizar and the gifts which he gladly offered^ The allies returned to Antioch, there to continue their quarrels until the Greeks retired to Cilicia. It was some years before the emperor John came back to Syria. The mainspring of Zanki's policy in Syria is again clearly revealed by his movements after the siege of Shaizar. Kafr tab was abandoned by the Greeks as they retreated, and occupied by the Moslems that very day (21st May)l But Zanki was in no haste to attempt the recovery ofthe places he had lostl He may have judged it prudent to await the final departure of the emperor.

On the 20th of October a severe earthquake visited Aleppo and the neighbourhood. Six hundred people are said to have perished in the ruins ofAtharib. The shocks continued until the summer ofnext year. Zanki returned to Mosul, where he waged war with the Ortoks, and Sawar continued to act as governor ofAleppo'. The year 1139 marks a turning-point in the hi.story of Damascus. From the time of Zanki's appearance in Syria Damascus was attacked on two sides, by the Latins ofthe south and the Moslems of the north. There can be little doubt which attack was the more dangerous. The Latins were quiet neigh- bours, on the whole, after their abortive expedition in 1129. When the peace of 1134 expired it may not have been formally renewed but there was very little war from that date to 1 1 39\\\". Zanki's attitudeand policy were widely different.

Every one of his three campaigns in Syria clearly showed that his Moslem neighbours were in danger from his schemes. He was unremit- ting in his efforts to subdue Damascus and its dependencies. The settlement of 1138 was a promise of security but the events of 11 39 proved it to be delusive. One obvious remedy for this chronic evil was a policy of alliance between Damascus and Jerusalem. When Zanki threatened Damascus once more in 11 39 Mu'in ed-din Anar resolved to appeal for help to Fulk of Jerusalem. By securing alliance with him he saved the situation and inaugurated a new period in the relations between Damascus and its neighbours. Zanki's excuse for interfering in the affairs of Damascus and renewinghostilities against it was the assassination ofShihab ed- din Mahmud. It took place on the night of the 22nd of June 1139^ His nominal successor was Jemal ed-din Muhammed, another son of Buri. Mu'in ed-din Anar, the deliverer of Damascus in 1135 and the defender of Homs in 1137-38, became wazir and actual rulerl There was need for a strong man such as Anar at this crisis, if the independence of Damascus was to be preserved. When it became clear what Zanki's intentions were, and that he would respect nothing but superior force, Anar sent an envoy to Fulk of Jerusalem to negotiate an alliance with him. Through Usama ibn munkidh^ he offered to defray by monthly payments the cost ofthe troops which might be sent, and agreed that Banyas should be handed Greek invasion of 1138, \\\"subsequente aestate\\\").

II4O-43 1 again._tQ^yria, although his career had still six years to run. 1 The Latin alliance had been conspicuously successful. Anar adhered to his__\\\\yise policy and Damascus continued to be at peace under his prudent government. The presence of the Latins in Syria did not affect the Moslem city. Forseven years it was equally undisturbed by the Latins of Jerusalem and by the Moslems ofnorthern Syria. Fulk waswell satisfied to allow his kingdom to rest in peace. Anar gave him no cause of offence, the borders of Tripolis were undisturbed and the garrison of Ascalon hardly stirred'. Being thus left alone he was content that the boundaries of his kingdom should remain as they were. Palestine was conquered and no danger was in sight. The \\\"spirit of the second generation,\\\" as it may be called, took possession of the Latins of Jerusalem. The men of the first generation regarded all Moslem Syria as an unoccupied promised land. Their successors viewed the Moslems as joint occupants with themselves. The country which was theirs \\\"bydivine right\\\" was practicallyco-extensive with the land they now occupied. They^ discovered that their neighbours had much in common with themselves. They adopted Eastern dress and Eastern habits and ceased to be \\\"exiles\\\" in a foreign land. The purpose of the first crusade was accomplished and its force was spent. The latter part of Fulk's reign is marked by much activity in castle building (i 140-43). On the east of the Dead Sea the strong castle of Kerak was built^ to increase the protection already given by Shaubak or Mont Royal. The Templars erected another at Safed. Two new castles were built in the direction of Ascalon. One was ten miles to the north of Ascalon, at Yabna, on the site and constructed from the ruins of an ancient town. Its name was Hibelin or Ibelin and it was gifted by the king to one Balian who took his name from the castle, Balian of Ibelin'.

His wife Melisend, daughter of Baldwin H, took the reins ofgovernment. She was well qualified to do so, and for several years her regency was simply a continuation, in every essential respect, ofher husband's reignI In Tripolis the year 1142 is made notable by the coming of the knights Hospitallers to those districts which afterwards became their chiefSyrian possessions. Hisn el-akrad, Rafaniya and other lands and castles in the neighbourhood were handed over to them by Raymond. Thus they became the principal defenders of El-bukai'a, the valley which gives access to the coast from the central plains of Syria, and also the nearest neighbours to the town of Homs. Raymond's pledge that he would not make peace with the Moslems without their consent shows how important their position was from the very firsts After Zanki left Syria in 1140 the relations between Antioch and Aleppo resumed the character which they had possessed in recent years during the periods of his absence. The old border warfare continued as before. Sawarwas still the Moslem leader, although another deserter from Damascus, the emir Laja, also takes a prominent part.

II42-43 unimportant^ After an interval oftwo or three years Raymond was desirous of peace (spring 1143)- He was attacked by a much more powerful enemy than Sawar. His territory was invaded by the Greek emperor and his very independence was threatened. The Latins needed all their strength for this con- test. It was fortunate for them that the Moslems of Aleppo took no particular advantage ofthe complications in which they were involved. But Zanki was on the alert in Mosul. The emperor John left Syria in 1138 with the intimation that he would return at the earliest opportunity. He did return in the latter part of the year 1 142. His intention was to reduce the Latins of the north to what he considered their due obedience. Before the Turkish conquest the Latin possessions had belonged to tlie Greeks and the leaders of the first crusade had sworn to restore them to the emperor Alexius. On these grounds John held that the country of Raymond and Joscelin rightfully belonged to him and that the Latin princes were only his vassals. He led his army first against Tell bashir. Joscelin attempted no resistance and gave hostages in token of submis- sion. Then the emperor marched to Antioch. Raymond refused to admit him to the city and even repudiated the agreement of 1137. John was informed that the Latin nobles held that Raymond had no authority to conclude such a treaty. As winter was approaching the emperor contented himself with laying waste the country and then retired to Cilicia''. 1here he died in April 1143, Hewas succeeded by his son Manuel.

His statement however that Raymond invited the emperor to Syria (xv. 19 and 10) is improbable. LA. i. 440 says that peace was made between the emperor and Raymond. Some sources speak of the emperor having actually entered Antioch (see Rohricht, p. 217, n. i).153\",\"A.D. 1140-44 'IMAD ED-DIN ZANKI I49 invaded Cilicia in the same year. War was waged for some time with varying fortune partly in Cilicia, partly in the neigh- bourhood of Antioch (1143-44). Finally Manuel's generals reduced Raymond to submission. Some time in 1144 he was compelled to go in person to Constantinople and there take an oath ofallegiance as the emperor's vassaP. It was in these circumstances, in 1144, that Zanki captured X the town of Edessa. Since 1140 his wars in Mesopotamia had been Moslem wars, chiefly in Ortok territory. In 1142 he was at war with the Kurds, in 1143-44'^ he strengthened his position round Maridin. Throughout these years he adhered to his policy of leaving the Latins undisturbed. It was at the instiga- tion of the emir of Harran that he finally attacked Edessa. But for his persuasion, so Zanki himself acknowledged, the attack would not have been made^ In any case the opportunity was rightly judged. Although Edessa was strongly fortified the population was chiefly Armenian and Syrian and the Latin garrison was small. Joscelin was absent in Antioch at the time^ for no danger was anticipated. Besides the Latins of Edessa at their best depended for support in serious danger on theirneigh- bours of Antioch and in 1144 this help #as not available. Raymond may not have been in Syria when the crisis came. At least, in all probability, he was still involved in the conse- quences of his war with the emperor Manuel. The contest between the Greeks and the Latins may thus be held chiefly responsible for the undoing of Edessa. Raymond and Joscelin were not good friends, but that alone could hardly have induced Raymond to deny his help^ Jerusalem although remote and now little in touch with northern affairs wasJoscelin'sonlyhope.

How far they went seems to be unre- corded. Joscelin himself has been severely blamed for the loss Qf__Edessa, His failure to raise the siege was largely due, no doubt, to causes which were beyond his personal control. It may be said however that he allowed Zanki to take him unduly by surprise. His residence in Tell bashir, although not in itself blameworthy^ may have prevented supervision ofthe defences of Edessa. The essential fact seems to be that the Latins were lulled into a feeling of false security by their long continued exemption from attack. Joscelin's personal courageand military capacity are praised by the Moslem historians^ But his own resources could not save Edessa and there was little he could do except appeal for help to others. Seeing this was without result the city was left to defend itself The first sign ofchange in Zanki's policy towards the Latins may be observed in the summer of 1144^ Some Latin castles in the province of Edessa were then attacked and captured. Joscelin should have been warned, whereas on the contrary Zanki was encouraged to proceed. Edessa, the capital, was not attacked until lat'b in the year. The interval was no doubt largelyspent in preparations. But Zanki carefullyconcealed his plans. Even when he started for Edessa he led his army first in another direction. The Moslem troops took their position under the walls of the city on Tuesday the 28th of November (1144)*. The defence was brave but it lasted no more than twenty-eight days. Zanki pressed the siege with all his power and employed every possible means of attack. The walls and towers were mined and seven siege towers were stationed round the city. At last a great breach was made in one of the walls. The garrison fought bravely in the breach, but this weakened their defence at other points and the enemy swarmed over the Wm * Against Tyre.

Zanki pledged his word that the defenders should be spared and then, in spite of that, sent at least the Latins amongst them to execution. Zanki's \\\"humanity\\\" on this occasion has been praised by some modern writers and it is true that the citizens of Edessa experienced some forbearance at his hands. For the sake of the future prosperity of the city it was needful to retain its native popula- tion. When the first hours of pillage and massacre were over protection was granted to the Armenian and Syrian Christians who chose to remain in Edessa. The ruins caused by the siege were repaired as quickly as possible and a Moslem garrison was installed where the Latins had ruled so long^ Zanki's capture of Edessa did not lead immediately to the conquest of the Latin province. Saruj seems to have been the only other Latin town which was captured before Zanki's death. Whatever his motives the atabek did not make any attempt to follow up his great success. As he did not live much longer it is not possible to be certain what his intentions were. Troubles in Mosul occupied him during the latter part of 1145 and the beginning of 1146.

A glance at the map shows the importance of its position. It stood like a rampart opposite Mosul and nearest the capital of the caliphs. It commanded the roads from Mosul to Aleppo and penetrated like a wedge between Moslem Syria and the emirates of Mesopotamia. By menacing east and south it isolated Aleppo and protected the Syrian Latins. Aleppo was weakened even more than the Latinswere strength- ened. It was almost encircled by Edessa and the adjoining state of Antioch. With its best allies in Mesopotamia it de- pended for safety on constant communication with the east. Butthe lineofmarch from Mosul to Aleppo was never free from peril so long as the Latins held Edessa. In the country from Harran to Rakka there was danger of attack at any moment and those who passed through safely left a dangerous enemy in the rear. The gain of Aleppo when Edessa was destroyed was threefold : its communication with the east was secured ; its enemy was now in front, no longer in the rear aswell ; it in turn began to encircle what was left of Latin territory. Even the death ofZanki and the division ofhis power which, followed made the position of the Latin states worse in one importantparticular. Their opponent was not so strong,but the very limitation of his power made him a more decided and determined enemy. Zanki was succeeded by two of his sons' Saifed-din Gazi and Nur ed-din Mahmud. The former secured Mosul and the eastern part of his father's dominions. The158\",\"154 NUR ED-DIN MAHMUD I latter ruled in the west with Aleppo for his capital. The river Khabur was the boundary between the brothers. The perma- nent independence of Aleppo which this division implied had been rendered possible by the capture of Edessa. Aleppo after that was strong enough to stand alone. Under Nureddin it entered on an independent career in which the conquest of the Latin states was a pressing duty. For if Nureddin respected his brother's territory and yet aimed at making conquests he was bound to seek them in the neighbouring Latin states. Not only so, he was free from those comolications with the Ortoks, thesultan,the caliphand the Kurds**^vhich had engaj^ed so much of Zanki's energy'. He owed this also to the limitation of his territory. Saifeddin inherited Zanki's Mesopotamian wars, Nur- eddin the lesser struggle with the Latins. The crusading states had a more dangerous foe than ever before, because his whole energy was directed against them. Nureddin's religious zeal and the earliest incidents ofhis reign combined in urging him to the task which the political situation imposed upon him. It must not however be forgotten, in qualification of what has been said, that the separation of Aleppo from Mosul was a source ofweakness also. Zanki's principal strength layin Meso- potamia. When it withdrew from the contest the opposing forces were not unequally matched.*- A great part of Nureddin's task, therefore, was the consolidation and strengthening of the dominions he inherited. By inclination and capacity he was perhaps better fitted for this work than for a career of mere con- quest. Both factors, the need of his kingdom and his personal character, may account for the fact that the progress made against theLatinsduringhisreignwas slowerthanweshouldhave expected. But it was he who built up a Syrian power capable ofchallenging the Latins without support from Mesopotamia. The fall of Edessa should have warned the Latins of the danger of disunion and of the enemy they had most to fear. It might have been a salutary lesson, although painful. It had no such effect, least of all in Jerusalem. During the period ofthe \\\"second crusade\\\" there was noco-operation between north and south, and even enmity began to replace the indifference which in itself had proved so harmful. The only Moslem wars159\",\"NUR ED-DIN MAHMUD 155 in which Jerusalem took much interestwerethose waged upon its own borders. One evil resultofthis spirit, neglectto support the efforts ofAntioch, has already been dwelt on. Another speedily followed. Damascus lay nearer than Aleppo and this was suffi- cient reason, in the eyes of those responsible for the policy of Jerusalem, for making war on it in preference to combining with Antioch against Nureddin. In spite of the efforts of Anar to cultivate friendly relations advantageous to both parties. Queen Melisend and her counsellors failed to see that Damascus was now an important ally and that persistent war would simply force Anar into the arms of Nureddin. They were guilty ofthe unutterable folly of directing against Damascus the whole force of the armies which Europe sent to recover Edessa and combat the power of the house of Zanki. Instead of combining with Antioch and Damascus against Nureddin they awaited the inevitable attack and employed the interval in alienating their allies and in giving Nureddin those advantages which they n\\\\eantime possessed. Nureddin's character contrasts considerably with that of his predecessor. He was not so much an imperialist nor perhaps as great a soldier as his father. Yet war with the Latins was a definite part of his policy in a manner not characteristic of Zanki's reign. The influence of his political position helps to explain this, and also his personal piety. Piety is a prominent feature in his character and appears in much that is related of him. He believed that the chiefprotectorof Islam and its lands was not himself but God, the one true God^ and he carried on war against the Christians as a religiousduty. Ifthe inspiration of the mere soldier was lacking somewhat, this motive took its place. The reflection that \\\"fortune is like a shadow, which if pursued flies away, if avoided follows after^\\\" marks a tempera- ment apt to fail when energetic initiative is required. But Nureddin was fortunate in his emirs. Asad ed-din Shirkuh devoted to his service for manyyears an enterpriseand resolution rarely excelled. It is not easy to apportion the military credit ofNureddin's reign between the sultan and his emirs. But from first to last he was master within his own dominions. He was a 1 I.A. ii. 307. ^ lA. ii. 300.160\",\"156 NUR ED-DIN MAHMUD A.D. I I46 wise and beneficent ruler and the prosperity of his reign was 1 due in the first place to himself. Even hisenemies did not with- hold their admiration of him^ His mode of life was simple^ as befitted a son ofZanki and a loyal follower of the Prophet. He embellished and improved the towns under his sway. He endowed public institutions to promote religion, to care for the sick and diseased, and for the advantage of travellers. The courts of justice were administered with equity and he himself gave an example of submission to them. By such means as much as by deeds ofarms he created the Syrian power which in the hands of Saladin,alongwith Egypt,completed theoverthrow ofthe Latin states. When Saifeddin hurried from the scene of his father's death to occupy Mosul Nureddin at once led back the Syrian troops in the camp to Aleppo. His occupation of the town gained its dependencies also. He had acted on the advice and with the assistance of Asad ed-din Shirkuh^ But he was neither of an age* nor of a character to be a puppet in the hands of anyone. Next month* when Nejm ed-din Ayub, governor of Ba'albek, Shirkuh's brother,entered theservice ofAnar the governorshipof Aleppowastransferred from Shirkuh toMejded-din ibned-daya\\\". The situation required a ruler capable ofacting with rapidity and decision. The death of Zanki encouraged his enemies to try their strength against his successor. When Raymond heard the news he sent troops against Aleppo and Kama. As they retired with their plunder Shirkuh followed. He recovered much that had been lost and pillaged Artah in retaliation foF the rest'.

It was too immediately followed by another event which threatened serious loss. In November Joscelin attempted to recover Edessa with the help of the Armenians still resident in the town. Nureddin hurried to its rescue and arrived before Joscelin had penetrated the citadel. The Latins were now compelled to face an attack on two sides and as they endeavoured to retreat were severely defeated. The treatment accordedloIHelrrtTabitantsbythevictordemandsoneobservation only. Neither Christians nor Moslems ever displayed much humanity in their treatment of one another and Nureddin's drastic punishment of the rebels was a security against similar revolts. It is easy to understand Nureddin's policy in a situation which threatened much danger..^ He was resolved to prosecute war with Antioch and cultivate the friendship of his Moslem neighbours. An agreement with his brother was easily made andthe importance ofpeace with Damascus was recognised and acted on. While frequent embassies passed between Aleppo and Damascus a vigorous attack was opened on the territories of Antioch. The list of the captured strongholds^ is sufficient to show how the tide was turning. The Latins were losing ground which they had held since the days of the first crusade. No wonder Raymond pressed for another like crusade and darkly painted the situation which the fall of Edessa had created. The treaty with Anar was signed in Damascus on the 28th of March (1147)2. It also marked an important gain. The way was prepared for the detachment of Damascus from alliancewith Jerusalem. The Latins furthered Nureddin's plans in this direction. He had scarcely celebrated his marriage with Anar's daughter, in accordance with the recent treaty, when an urgent request for help arrived from Damascus. Nureddin responded gladly. The Latins of Jerusalem in spite of Anar's protests and warnings had formally broken their alliance and ^ Artah, Barat (Mamula), Basarfut (Basarfun), Kafrlatha, A.S.

Tuntash*, emir of Bosra and Sarkhad, had tempted them by offering the surrender of his towns. Some recognised how unwise it was to listen to the offer, but they were overruled. Anar threw his army in front of the threatened position and was promptly joined by Nureddin, about the beginning of June'. The Latins found they had been anticipated' and that the enemy were too strong. They beat a retreat with much difficulty. Their privations in a bare and waterless region, with the enemy in the rear, are graphically described by ^illiam of Tyre . Anar was still anxious for peace* and may not have pressed his advantage. After the occupation of Bosra and Sarkhad the allies returnedto Damascus. But the Latins showed no willingness to renew the broken alliance. Next year they continued the war and wasted on it the strength ofthe \\\" second crusade\\\" (i148). ^/Y The news of the fall of Edessa had stirred once more to its utmos t depths the crusading spirit ofthe west . The enthusiasm / was greatest in France, the home of the first crusade. Pope Eugene_encouraged a French_expedition in Italy he had ; contests of his own to wage. The French were most akin to the Syrian Latins and responded to the preaching of St Bernard and the influence of their king, Louis VH. St Bernard secured also the adhesion of the emperor Conrad His army increased . the size of the crusade but diminished its unity and so perhaps its efficiency. A fleet of English and Flemish ships was the first to start. Its principal achievement was in Portugal, against the Moslems of that country. Only part of the expedition continued the voyage to Syria. They arrived in the spring of 1148 and took part in the siege of Damascus. The French and German crusades took the old routeby land through the Greek empire ; the Germans started first. As before there was discord, suspicion and fighting between the crusaders and the Greeks. Manuel still regarded the Latins as merely his Wm > A.S. TyregivesTantais. ' A.S.Cairo50.

It scarcely required the presence of the Normans of Sicily, his hereditary enemies, to renew the old feuds. Finally Manuel made peace with the Moslems of Asia Minor and took no part in the progress of the crusade. Conrad started from Constantinople without waiting for the French. The enemy were fully prepared to meet him. Hisarmysplit into two parts, both ofwhich came to a miserable end. The failure of provisions led to the final disaster. The French, who followed, were more fortunate. They kept farther south, through a difficult country, in the hope of avoiding the enemy. They were accompanied by part of the German army after Conrad returned to Constantinople. They learned watch- fulness by defeat and succeeded in repelling the enemy. A large part of the army sailed from Attalia to Antioch. There were not ships for the mass of humbler pilgrims and these were left to their fate. About the middle of April (1148), a month after Louis' arrival, Conrad came by sea from Constantinople. He landed in ' Akka and other crusading bands which also came by sea disembarked in the territory of Jerusalem. The crusaders had now to choose between two policieswhich the Syrian Latins laid before them. One was advocated by Raymond of Antioch and the northern states, the other by the Latins of Jerusalem. Each party doubtless considered its own advantage, but Raymond's proposal to attack Nureddin was that which deserved adoption. The original purpose of the— crusade was to retrieve the fall of Edessa,Jt-w as i n th^^jiorth only that the Latins were losing ground, and Nureddin was by far their most dangerous enemy. The security and prosperity^ of the south may be judged from the conclusion which Conrad seems to have come to, that the Syrian Latins required no service from the crusade. The southern Latins proposed to attack Anar of Damascus. He was willing and anxious to remain at peace. If attacked he was certain to join hands with Nureddin. There would be alliance once more between Damascus and the Moslems of the north as there had been in the days of Tugtakin. It may be granted that the occupation of Damascus would have been a decided gain^ but this was not 1 See chap. Ill, page 127.164\",\"l6o ATTACK ON DAMASCUS A.D. II48 the opportunity. War with Nureddin was inevitable, for the choice lay between attacking him directly and separately' and attacking Damascus with him as its ally-. Conrad had landed in the south and was surrounded by the party which proposed war with Damascu s. He allowed him- self to be persuaded in favour of the southern policy. Louis remained in Antioch till June. He left it partly, perhaps, because of an intrigue of Raymond's with his wife'. He also gave his adhesion to the plan which had been formed in Jerusalem. Conrad and others were inclined to return home, but all joined in the expedition. In the latter part of July the Latins left Tiberias, their gathering point, and the siege of Damascus began on Saturday the 24th*. Neither Antioch nor Tripolis took any part. Within five days the besiegers were in full retreat. They approached the city from the south-west and forced their way up to the walls through the orchards which stretch for some miles down the valley. During the next two days they in turn stood on the defensive, behind ramparts of felled trees. Rein- forcements were pouring into the city and relief was expected from Saifeddin and Nureddin. On the fourth day the Latins made little or no response to the attacks and challenges of the enemy. The Moslems feared some stratagem. In reality no doubt the question of retreat was being discussed.

The account of William of Tyre is generally accepted\\\\ This historian says that during the siege, the duration of which he does not state, someofthe SyrianknightswerebribedbyAnarandtreacherously advised that the allied camp should be moved from theorchards to the open country south and east of the city. They are supposed to have done so because they knew that the second position was untenable owing to the difficultyofobtainingwater and provisions. The leaders discovered this after the change had been made and resolved to retreat when they found that the orchards had been occupied by the enemy. It is to be remembered that the new position spoken of lay n just outside the woods in which the crusaders were and we are asked to suppose that the leaders were in utter ignorance of the character of the ground there and took no precaution to ascertain whether the (alleged) statements made to them were true or false. The Arabic historians have no account of the \\\"^ movement and Abu Ya'la's narrative leaves room for it only on the night before the retreat was commenced. If assigned to that night it becomes almost incredible, for we have then to suppose (as has been done) that \\\"a single glance revealed the situation2\\\" and yet that the leaders had supposed they were moving to a better position. It is much more likely that Conrad and the malcontentswho had advocated returning home felt it necessary to blame someone else and gave currencyto the story. No wonder that William of Tyre confesses that there was no agreement regarding the authors of the \\\"treachery^\\\" It is quite possible that some movement preliminary to retreat was later given an unjustifiable significance.

There was_43rQhah]y a revulsion of feeling among the crusaders at the time. The Latins of Jerusalem had declared that it would be an easy niaUer to capture Parnascus*. They had done^so, no doubt, to overcome the unwillingness which some felt regarding the undertaking. It made their position difficultwhen the siegfi^id not at oncesucc^ed. The food taken with the army was insufficient^ and siege material was apparently wanting. The season was unfavourable to a prolonged campaign and it was clear that every day made the arrival ofpowerful reinforcements more certain. Nureddin and Saifeddin were not far off and it was known that the city had already been reinforced^ These facts were all discouraging and Conrad in particular was ready to make the most of them. Even the Syrian Latins had reason on reflection to reconsider their position. Theyare said to have been alienated by a proposal^to give the city, on its conquest, to a crusader'. They could not now fail to realise how likely it was that the siege would throw Q^Lflaascu? into the hands of Nureddin and his brother*. There is every reason to believethat Anar pressed these facts on their notice' and it is not unlikely that his representations were accompanied by \\\"gifts\\\".\\\" Hence no doubt the statement that the Syrian Latins were bribed. Anar had much reason to desire that the siege should be raised without the co-operation of his northern allies. They required as a condition oftheir assistance that the town should be placed in their handsl It is no wonder that Anar's suspicions were roused, in spite of the assurance that the city would be evacuated whenever the objects of the alliance were attained.

It is not clear why the Syrian knights acted as they did. Probably it was too soon to begin a fresh and arduous undertakingaftertherecent failure. Possibly the antagonism latent between the Latins of Syria and the crusaders from Europe now becameactive. Recent incidents\\\"] and the impression produced bythe crusading host,as contrasted / with thatofthesmall andscattered bandsofpilgrims and soldiers/ with which the Syrians were familiar, were well calculated to] effect this. The Syrian Latins felt that the crusaders were more foreigners than kinsmen, that their own home was now Syria not Europe, and that their interestswere not identical with those of the newcomers. Even if this sense of distinction and estrangement did not operate to prevent co-operation againsStt . Ascalon its accentuation was yet one of the gravest results of the crusade. The danger which had threatened Moslem Syria had passed away. The principal features of the situation now are the enthusiastic confidence of the Moslems and the weakened position ofthe Syrian Latins due to the indifferenceand distrust which Europeans had learned to cherish toward them. Islam and Christendom had measured arms and the followers of the Prophet had been victorious. The armies of Christendom had been impotent against the swords and prayers of the \\\"true believers'.\\\" After the failure of such an effort there seemed no ^ \\\"Factum aliquod in quo memoriam suam posteris possint reddere commenda- bilem\\\" (Tyrexvii. 7). 2 Thebreak upof the crusade, it istobe remembered,wasnot the resultofany actualdefeat. Its aspectwas therefore the more miraculous. When Damascuswas hard pressed during the siege Anar moved the citizensbyreligious appeals andthe exhibition of 'Othman's Koran, the sacred relic of the city. On another occasion168\",\"l64 NUR ED-DIN MAHMUD A.D. II48-49 reason to fear anything that Europe might ever attempt again. Besides the effort had expended itself and only the Syrian Latins remained to be dealt with. On the other side the discord and suspicion which had been aroused between Syrians and Westerns showed its effects at once. The hope of another crusade was indefinitely postponed and the annual stream of pilgrims which brought money and men and arms to the holy land was seriously checked and diminished. Louis indeed remained loyal to the cause, but it was never in his power to send another crusade. The popes, on their part, were wholly engaged, during the next forty years, by their contest with the German emperors. Even the feeling of bitterness against the Greek emperor roused, or rather stirred into fresh life, in Europe by the incidents of the crusade, had its effect later on the fortunes of the Latins. The contest with Nureddin had now to be fought out with little help from Europe. Anar's conference with Nureddin at Ba'albek just after the si^e of Damascus* was no doubt for the purpose of arranging further co-operation. It could not yet be realised that the crusade was ended. Before the princes separated a proposal that they should attack 'Araima came from the count of Tripolis. Thecastlewas in his own state andhad been occupied by a grandson of Raymond of Toulouse, a crusader who now claimed the whole princedom^ The Moslem princes willingly agreed. The castle was captured and destroyed and Bertram, Raymond's rival, was carried prisoner by Nureddin to Aleppo\\\". As soon as it became evident that Damascus was no longer in danger Anar was willing to make peace again with Jerusalem. The Latins for a short time continued the war by incursions into the Hauran. They sued for peace probably when Louis left Palestine. In May 1149 peace was granted them for two years*. Affairs thus returned to their original condition in the south. Nureddin was urged to spend more money on preparations for war and less on religious institutions and devotees. He replied that the prayers offered for Islam were its best weapons. * I.A. i. 470, ii. 161. » I.A., Kem. ' AbuYa'lain A.S.iv.60,Cairo55. * Abu VaMain A.S.

Baldwin had the more reason to be satisfied because Mas'ud of Iconium, attracted by the news of Raymond's death, had begun to attack the scattered possessions of the Latins in Euphratesia (Sep- tember)'. Joscelin of Tell bashir purchased his enemy's with- drawal after the loss ofseveral ofhisfew remainingstrongholds'. During the same year (1149) events occurred which turned Nureddin's attention for a time in another direction. His brother Saifeddin died about the beginning of November and Nureddin was invited tooccupy Sinjar. Hedid so(14th Novem- ber)* but almost immediately surrendered it to another brother Kutb ed-din Maudud. It was agreed that Nureddin should confine himself to Syria as before and that Kutb ed-din should succeed in Mesopotamia. He ruled in Mosul from 1149 to 1 170. Nureddin's action may have been influenced in part by the situation in Damascus which again invited his interference. Mu'in ed-din Anar had died on 29th August^ and the troubles associated with dynastic change had broken out although Tugtakin's grandson, Mujir ed-din, continued nominal ruler. It was a favourable opportunity for bringing Damascus into line with Aleppo against the Latins, perhaps even for making it wholly dependent.

But Nureddin's first attempt had no substantial success. He advanced against Damascus pro- bably in March (1150) and sought to gain his purpose by professing friendship and offering alliance against the Latins^ But the Damascenes were suspicious of his good faith and unwilling to break the peace with Baldwin which Anar had renewed last year. The Latins promptly showed their willing- ness to assist their allies. Heavy rains disturbed Nureddin's movements. Finally he contented himself with the barren acknowledgment that his name should be mentioned in public prayer,el-khutba,afterthoseofthe caliph and thesultan. Peace was made in the beginning of May 2.

The last of the possessions of Antioch east of the \\\"backbone of Syria\\\" had been gained by the capture of Famiya,and everythingwas quiet in this direction.

The emperor Manuel was also attracted by the situation, and proposed that the castles still remaining should be occupied by Greek soldiers. It was re- solved to accept his proposal.

Some captures may also have been made in 1152, but most of the intervening years were occupied in efforts to gain possession of Damascus. Until this was accomplished it was the main objectof Nureddin's policy, and drew him away from Euphratesia. The precise occasion of Nureddin's second attack on Da- mascus, in 1151, is not explained by the Arabic historians. Baldwin's second appearance in the north may have been of some influence. But still more important is the fact thatAnar's last truce with Jerusalem was just expiring. The time was opportune for another attempt to bring about a reversal of the late prince's policy. Nureddin reached the neighbourhood of Damascus about the end of April2, shortly before the truce expired, and remained there until the beginning of June. He was compelled to move by the advance of an army from Jerusalem and finally retreated into the Bika'. Instead of pur- suing him the allies entered the Hauran. Their object seems to have been to attack Sarkhak of Bosra, who was disaffected to Damascus. Nureddin had already sent 4000 horse into the Hauran, but their movements are not recorded. The Latins are said to have been repulsed by the emir of Bosra. Their return to Jerusalem was caused, more probably, by the ravages of an Egyptian fleet which unexpectedly attacked the coast-towns at this very time^ Nureddin continued operations some time longer.

An attack on Banyas in December 1151', and the events connected with it, were an episode for which Mujir ed-din was not responsible. The aggressors were Turkomans whom he disclaimed, and although the Latins retaliated on the territories of the Bika' and Ayub of Ba'albek could not refrain from making a counter-attack on the invaders, Mujir ed-din's friendly spirit prevented further hostilities. It was no doubt about this time that he commenced the payment of the annual contribution which was evidenceofhis weaknessand dependence on the Latins. In 1152 the only military movement from Damascus seems to have been against the emir of Bosra*. The most important events of the year 1152 took place within the borders of Jerusalem. For some years Baldwin III had displayed qualities which showed his fitness to exercise the complete sovereignty that was still denied him. His interest in the affairs of the north marked also a certain independence of the policy of his advisers. But his mother Melisend was unwilling to resign the position she had occupied during his minority and the king chafed under the restrictions put upon his authority. Matters came to a crisis in 1152. A com- promiseby which the kingdom was divided into two portions did not satisfy Baldwin. He demanded his full inheritance. Civil war broke out and the queen-mother was besieged in the citadel ofJerusalem before Baldwin received the recognition he desired. These events must have been watched with interest by the surrounding Moslem states. It was fortunate for the Latins that their enemies did not take more advantageoftheirquarrels. Damascus remained a dependent ally.

The Latin army gathered at Nablus and the daring invader pitched his camp on the Mount of Olives. The retreat was as sudden as the attack. A vigorous sally from Jerusalem routed the enemy and they were again defeated as they sought safety in flight over the Jordan. Baldwin's independent reign had just commenced and the victory seemed a happy omen for the future. The king's desire to signalise his accession and the encouragement just received prompted a further enterprise. It was resolved to attack Ascalon, \\\"the bride of Syria.\\\" The project required all Baldwin's energy to accomplish it. The conditions were favourable, yet the siege lasted from January to August (i153)^ It was the absence of all prospect of relief and the apparent determination of the Latins which induced the citizens to accept the favourable terms offered to them. Egypt had recently been more active than for many years, but a new ruler preferred his personal advantage to the safety of Ascalon. The only help he sent was by sea, a supply of provisions and men on one occasion. Nureddin had been appealed to, and even Mujir ed-din showed for a time some inclination to assist. About the end of May these two princes approached Banyas in company. But there a dispute arose and the enterprise was abandoned.

He returned to Damascus in the second week of June, and Nureddin made no further attempt to help the distressed Moslem bride^ Ascalon was one of the strongest and wealthiest of the Syrian towns, and the last Moslem possession in Palestine. Its capture completed the conquest of the country. A gate of entrance to Egyptian troops was closed, and the way cleared for an attack on Egypt. The Latins were jubilant at the capture. But their gain was more in appearance than in reality. Ascalon had long been harmless and Egypt inactive. By the opportunity of invading Egypt the disposition to neglect affairs in the north was strengthened. The events of this very year made a serious change in the situation there. Thevacillationof Mujired-din,his failure tohelpAscalon and his quarrel with Nureddin created a party in Damascus which resolved to put Nureddin in his place. Shirkuh's brother, Ayub of Ba'albek,was a moving spirit in the plot'. Nureddin accused his most dangerous opponents, those who were loyal to Mujir ed-din, of treacherous overtures to himself, and in this manner secured their disgrace and removal'. Then Shirkuh brought matters to a crisis. He appeared before Damascus with a con- siderable force (early in April 1154)^ and acted in such a manner that Mujir ed-din refused to receive him. When Nureddin heard this he advanced in person and laid siege to the city (April i8th)'. Seven days later the town was captured (April 25th)''.

The blow came so suddenly that the Latin alliance was unavailing. For the next ten years Nureddin manifestly inclines to peace with his Latin neighbours. Time was needed for the welding together of long divided interests. The combined resources of the Latin states were still superior. Nureddin ruled no Meso- potamian towns, as Zanki had done. His sovereignty over Moslem Syria remained imperfect. Ba'albek did not follow the example ofits metropolis. Shaizar may not have been the only place of some importance to maintain a certain independence, for some years to come. Besides, the old country of Edessa was still unconquered. Obviously the desire to round off his territories northwards of Aleppo held Nureddin back in some degree from attack on the Latin states. His wars with Baldwin in 1157 and 1158, and again in 1160, were commenced by the other side. So long as the Latins left Nureddin undisturbed his only pressing motive to engage in war against them was the call of religious duty. Mere territorial ambitions had an outlet in that part of Joscelin's country which the sultan of Iconium now possessed. Besides, after 1159 the Greek empire became a more pressing danger to the Moslems of Syria than it had been for many years. Fear of the emperor Manuel undoubtedly acted as a check on Nureddin from that date onwards. Some influences have just been named which prevented the capture of Damascus from becoming, as it might have been, a powerful stimulus to Nureddin in the prosecution of his Latin wars. But the acquisition of Damascus by Nureddin is none the less a landmark in the history. An important step was taken towards the removal of the disunity which had made the ^ A existence of the Latin states a possibility. united Latin \\\"t power now stretched along the Latin border.

When the Moslem sultan judged that the time had come the way was open for an attack on the Holy City. When Nureddin occupied Damascus one of the charges on the revenues ofthe city was an annual payment to the Latins of Jerusalem. It seems to have been conceded by Mujir ed-din sometimeafter the death ofAnar. Nureddin's treatment ofthe obligation is only a matter of inference. It appears probable, however, that he continued the payments The fact, if certain, would be a striking illustration of his policy, for the time, towards the Latins of the south. It can hardly be doubted that his principal aim was to avoid provoking attack, and to make it appear that the situation in Damascus was unchanged by his advent there. He required time to establish himself firmly in his new possessions, and freedom to complete his schemes of conquest in the north. Even virtual tribute to the Latins of Jerusalem was not too great a price to pay for these advantages. On whatever conditions, almost certainly in accordance with some treaty, Baldwin left Nureddin undisturbed. After all he could hardly undo the conquest now, and there were aggressive movements from the side of Egypt to be guarded against*. So two years passed in peace. It was probably the time set by treaty. After its expiry both parties were willing that it should — be extended. In the end of 1156 (November December)' peace was arranged for another year. Nureddin bound him- self to pay 80CXD dinars. ^ During these same years the northern Latins, also, left the Moslems undisturbed. In Antioch there was a new ruler, Reginald ofChatillon.

He dissipated his energy in other undertakings than the war against Nureddin, which de- manded the concentration of every power. First he seems to have embroiled himself with the Armenian prince Thoros^ Under the vigorous rule of this sovereign a new Armenian state was becoming powerful in Cilicia and should have been a helpful ally. The conflict does not appear to have been serious but it was ominous for the future. It led, also, to an adventurous expedition against Cyprus in the year 1156^ This dissipated forces that should have been employed elsewhere. It was aimed against the Greek emperor, who is said not to have fulfilled promises he made to Reginald to induce him to be his ally against Thoros. -^ In 1155, accordingly, Nureddin was at perfect liberty to pursue his scheme of conquest against the sultan of Iconium. Mas'ud had recently died (1155) and been succeeded by his son Kilij Arslan^ The time was the more opportune because Kilij Arslan was already involved in war with Ibn Danishmend. While he was thus occupied in the summer of 1155 Nureddin captured several ofhis castles and towns^ Theywereprincipally those which Mas'ud a few years before had gained from the Latins.

But this can only have been one ofseveral. Nureddin had spent the winter in Damascus. He started north again in the third week of ApriP. On the way news reached him that the Latins had been repulsed. He seems himselfto have made an attack on Harim'. The Latins soon bought a cessation of hostilities by surrendering part ofthe revenues ofthe district. Nureddin had another care than military operations. On the 13th of May the first of a series of earthquake shocks was felt in the north. They caused much destruction in Aleppo, Homs and Hama and were especially frequent from October onwards. They did not affect Damascus until the beginning of 1157*. Nureddin was actively employed during this time in rebuilding operations and in taking precautions against the surprise of defenceless posts. A settlement was made with Kilij Arslan'. Nureddin returned to Damascus in Ramadan, before the middle of November 1156. In the following month he renewed peace with Baldwin as already described. Almost immediately after this, however, Nureddin came to blows with the southern kingdom for the first time. In the beginning ofFebruary 1157* Baldwin broke the treaty which he had just concluded. William of Tyre says that want of money drove him to the step. He heard that herds and large droves of horses were pasturing in the neighbourhood of Banyas, relying on the security of the recent truce. The temptation was too g^reat. Baldwin fell unexpectedly upon them. Nureddin's first move was to occupy Ba'albek, at the end of ApriP.

While Nur- eddin was still in Ba'albek news came from two quarters of successes gained by his lieutenants. Shirkuh defeated a band of Latins in the north, doubtless those who were raiding the territories of Homs and Hama^ Nasir ed-din, the sultan's brother, surprised and routed a train of the knights of St John on their way to occupy Banyas for its greater security. Shirkuh joined Nureddin at Ba*albek and it was resolved to attack Banyas. Some time was spent in preparation. Nureddin left Damascus to undertake the siege on the nth of May^ Across the valley on the hills to the west, looking down on Banyas, was the strong castle of Hunain. Shirkuh's victory in its neigh- bourhood was probably a check administered to its garrison. The little town of Banyas was occupied,but the strong castle on the heights to the east held out^ A relieving force approached from the south. Nureddin burned the captured town and raised the siege of the castle. Baldwin repaired the damaged walls, left provisions for the garrison, and started homeward.

Until now it had been independent But its wallswereruined byan earthquake,apparentlyin thelatterpartof the month of August^ and it was easily seized in its defenceless state'. Nureddin's departure seems to have put an end tooperations in the south. But the Latins only changed the point of their attack. They advanced from Tripolis against the exposed valley of the Orontes. They were encouraged by the damage which the earthquakes had done and by the arrival in Beirut of crusaders under Dietrich of Flanders. There is no record of what Nureddin had been doing since he left Banyas. But as soon as the Latins began to attack Er-ruj he advanced against them with forces gathered in Homs and the neighbourhood. The besiegers atonce retired to Antioch. Just after this, early in October, Nureddin fell ill at Sarmin. His illness was so serious that he made arrangements for the event of his death. He nominated his brother, Nasir ed-din, emir of Harran, to be his successor. There were disturbances when this prince entered Aleppo as heir-designate. Apparently he was opposed by the governor, Ibn ed-daya. Possibly his conduct was not judicious and exposed him to the charge of disloyalty. But there was no breach, as yet, between the brothers. Nureddin recovered and Nasir ed-din returned to Harran*. The news of Nureddin's illness encouraged the Latins to resume operations. They made an attack on Shaizar. The town was captured but, just as in the year 1138, the citadel at its upper end defied every attack. .There were also disputes regarding the future lordship of the town.

Abu Ya'la relates that the Latins were driven away by a force chiefly Ismailian. From Christmas day 1157 to the beginning of February of the following year the Latins besieged an important castle not far from Antioch. It is difficult to suppose that the castle was Harim, for that seems to have been in their hands already. On this occasion, at last, their enterprise was rewarded by success. Nureddin could bring no help and the castle surrendered^ In the south little use was made of the period of Nureddin's absence and illness. In November or December 1157 a Moslem castle was captured in the Hauran^. In March of the following year an expedition ravaged the same district and penetrated as far as Dariya near Damascus. Nureddin returned to Damascus on the 7th of April, fully restored to health. At once he proceeded to retaliate on the Latins. Shirkuh made an inroad on the territories of Sidon. Nureddin conducted operations in the district of Suwad from May to Augusts Baldwin hastened to defend his borders. The principal incident was a battle by \\\" the wooden bridge\\\" which crossed the Jordan just below the lake of Tiberias (15th July)^ Nureddin's emirs lost courage and fled. Only a small band of personal attendants and devoted followers held their ground round the sultan. They kept the enemy in check and drew off safely, exasperated at the desertion of their comrades. During 1158 the activity of Egypt,which had been provoked by the fall of Ascalon, continued to manifest itself From March to May there were a whole series of inroads at different Wm ^ AbuYa'lain A.S.iv.96givesthename Harimand Tyre also, althoughin the chapter heading only (Migne's text xviii. 19).

This time he passed over Nasir ed-din and chose another brother, Kutb ed-din of Mosul. He was sufficientlywell to start for Aleppo about the middle of March. His presence there was urgently required*. / During 1158 Reginald was the ally of Thoros against Ibn Mas'ud of Iconium. For some time the Greek emperor Manuel had used the ruler of Iconium as a check on the growing power of the Armenian prince. Reginald took the other side. In the end of the year Manuel intervened in person. The Cilician towns quickly yielded to his arms. Thoros ventured no resis- tance. The emperor passed the winter in Cilicia. Reginald with difficulty obtained pardon after a humiliating submission. Baldwin also appeared in person before the emperor. Through his influence and by representing to Manuel the value to the Latins oftheArmenian alliancehebroughtabouta reconciliation. Thoros was permitted to hold his possessions as a vassal of the emperor. These events made the Greek empire a factor in Syrian politics once again. Its influence on the whole was favourable to the Latins. Reginald's feelings certainly were not very cordial but his part in Antiochwas almost over.

In September 1158 hehadmarried Manuel's niece and from that time he enjoyed his particular favour. The advantage to the Latins consisted not so much in any direct assistance they ever received as in the mere influence of his friendly attitude. The prospect of a conflict with the Greek emperor was a check on Nureddin's policy and well calculated to restrain him from pressing the Latins too hardly. In 1158-59 it appeared as if the borders of the empire were approaching Nureddin's own and hewas readyto makesacrifices to secure that the emperor should depart. In the spring of 11 59 the emperor Manuel entered Antioch and remained there until an agreementwas made with Nureddin in the beginning of June^ It scarcely required the threat of an attack on Aleppo to secure the release of a large number of Christian captives. Amongst them was Bertram, who had been captured in 1148, and the Master of the Temple, who had been made prisoner in the battle beside lake Hule, north of Tiberias, in 11 571 It appears that Joscelin of Edessa, after a captivity of nine years, had died in prison just the month before^ By these surrenders Nureddin gained exemption from attack and acknowledgment of the position he had already won. His northern policy for some years past had aimed at nothing further. All he desired was granted when the Latins consented to give him peace. Nureddin had still to dealwith other complications. Events connected with his recent illness led him to an expedition against Harran.

According to one of the sources, however, these conquests were restored when peace was made'. The operations cannot have lasted beyond the first month of 1 160. While Nureddin was thus employed Baldwin in the south took the opportunity to make an incursion into the territories of Damascus. Nejm ed-din Ayub was governor there.

Both sides were prepared for attack, but all summer neither took the offensive. When winter came truce was made for two years*.

It may be conjectured that the two years peace concluded with Baldwin in the south was now made applicable to the north also^ There was a longer pause than usual in the contest between Moslem and Christian. Nureddin was doubtless influenced by his desire to perform the pilgrimage to Mekka. For once the call of religion coun- selled peace. Two illnesses in successive winterswerea warning to the sultan that he must not delay to perform this duty of the faithful. The pilgrimage month in 1161 fell at the close of the year. With peace before and with peace following Nureddin paid his debt of piety. This time of peace was acceptable to the Latins also. In Antioch the Queen Mother and the Patriarch took the conduct of affairs. Baldwin shared their responsibility until Bohemond, the young son of Constance and Raymond, became nominal ruler. The bonds of friendship with the Greek emperor were strengthened by the marriageofthe young prince's sister, Maria, with the emperor in December ii6i^ It was unfortunate that this alliance involved a slight to the sister of Raymond III of Tripolis, which made that prince an enemy of the Greeks. The death of Baldwin followed not long after. The general ruin caused by an earthquake in northern Syria and negotiations connected with Maria's marriage occupied him in Antioch during the latter part of 1161. He was there when his mother died (nth September)', and there his own fatal illness overtook him. After a time he moved south. He died at Beirut on the loth of February 1162*, only thirty-two years of age. His brother Amalric was chosen his successor he was twenty-seven. ; was defeated bythe king ofJerusalem.

A com- plete change comes quickly over the aspect of affairs. Events move more rapidly. The petty incidents of recent years give place to movements on a larger scale and with more of epic interest. The destinies ofthe Latin states hurry on and Moslem victory comes more clearly into sight. Amalric's share in the change is not easily estimated, for it was subordinate to the initiative of others. But his personal character must have largely affected the issue. Fired by youth and ambition his attitude to the kingdom was verydifferent from thatofBaldwin. He was not satisfied with thecondition ofthe Latin states. He aimed at extending his dominions and indulged in far-reaching dreams ofconquest. He sought help from Europe and from the emperor Manuel to realise his plans. He married a Greek, daughter of a nephew of Manuel's, and so continued to enjoy the emperor's favour. The mere fact of Amalric's succession to the throne tended to originate a new policy and to create a new situation in Jerusalem. But other events anticipated his action with the same effect. Nureddin's truce with Baldwin expired at the end of 1162. As warfare was not resumed in 1163 it may be inferred that peace was renewed for another year, both in north and souths Nureddin was indisposed to take the aggressive and Amalric waited for some response to his appeals for help. Meantime, however, the Latin prince embarked on an enterprise without parallel since the early days of the Latin conquest. In the autumn of 1163 he invaded Egypt.

II63-64 that country was passing through a crisis. In September 1161 Talai' ibn Ruzzik, wazir of the Egyptian caliph, and sultan, as he was even called, died. In 1163 the contest for his position resolved itself into one between two emirs, Dirgam and Shawir. Shawirwas compelled to flee from the countryand finallybetook himself to Damascus seeking help from Nureddin. It was now that Amalric, by his invasion of Egypt, gave the first outward evidence of the spirit by which he was animated (September 1 163)*. It seems that tribute had been paid to the Latins and was now withheld by Dirgam. The Hospitallers, whose chief strongholds were on the south-western borders, contributed largely to the expedition, and their Master, Gilbert d'Assailly, was an energetic supporter of the enterprise. Amalric himself, before his accession, had been count ofAscalon from the time of its capture in 1 153, and this no doubt, in part, explains his policy and the closeness of his association with the Hospitallers. It was anticipated that Egypt might be conquered and annexed. The Latins boasted of a victory gained over Dirgam's troops near Bilbais, But when the dams of the Nile were broken and the country flooded they were compelled to retreat. The invasion was really a complete failure. Of still greater novelty and of more importance was an expedition sent by Nureddin in the following spring. The year 1164 is a landmark in the history of the period, for in it was taken the first step towards a union of Moslem Syria and Moslem Egypt. It was towards the end of October 1 163 that Shawir reached Damascus'.

I164 SHIRKUH'S first INVASION 187 powers Nureddin hesitated. The territories of Jerusalem intervened between Damascus and Egypt and the hostility of Amalric had to be reckoned with. The credit of having rightly judged the situation and determined Nureddin's policy at this critical moment belongs once more to Asad ed-din Shirkuh'^. The Egyptian people could be counted on to prefer a Moslem sultan to Latin domination, and Shirkuh saw that no possible Egyptian ruler was a serious rival. Doubtless he urged the advantage which the possession of Egypt would bring Nureddin in his prosecution of the holy war. With Egypt and Moslem Syria under one ruler Jerusalem would lie between two fires. From the Delta Nureddin might employ a fleet against the Syrian sea-coast and interrupt communications with Europe. It seems clear that personal ambition also had a place in the number of Shirkuh's motives. In spite of his eminence and his abilities he had hitherto played a subordinate part. Without doubt he recognised that he would be more independent as the ruler of Egypt and might if circumstances were favourable establish there an independent dynasty. Throughout the whole history of the attack on Egypt Shirkuh was the moving spirit. It was he, more truly than Nureddin, who brought about a decisive change in the strength and composition of the Moslem forces which were arrayed against the Latin states. Shirkuh was given command of the Moslem troops which were sent to Egypt in ApriP. Nureddin made an incursion into the territory ofJerusalem to draw attention from the expedition as it passed the Latin borders. The march was accomplished in safety and Shawir was restored without difficulty to his former position. 1 More exactly one-third after deduction of the expenses of the army.

The Syrian emir was in no haste to depart. Shawir saw that his independence was threatened by the power which had restored him. His rash promises when a fugitive in Damascus were quoted against him. To shake off this yoke he needed assistance and he turned to Amalric of Jerusalem. The opportunity suited the schemes of the Latin prince and he quickly responded to the appeal (July). Shirkuh fought at great disadvantage against the allies. Although he stubbornly maintained himself for three months in Bilbais (Pelusium), at the end of that time he was glad to accept Amalric's terms. They were that Latins and Syrians should both evacuate the country (October 1 164). The real gain of this year was not made in Egypt but in Syria. Amalric was induced to make terms by the news of disaster in Antioch and ofattackon theborders ofhisown territory. His absence had given Nureddin a favourable opportunity fora more serious attack on the Latin states than he had made for years. The importance of the effort is marked by the co-operation of the emirs of Upper Mesopotamia. The object of the allies was probably to narrow the limits of the Latin territories by the conquest of frontier castles. The principality of Antioch was selected for the first attacks Nureddin left Damascus not long after Shirkuh's departure. As he passed the outskirts ofTripolis and the fields of Hisn el-akrad his soldiers gave notice of their presence by their forays. The plain at the foot of the hills, El-bukai*a, was the scene of one of the narrowest escapes of Nureddin's life. The knights Hospitallers of Hisn el-akrad sallied out and surprised the sultan's little camp. They pene- trated among the tents as Nureddin and his men sprang to their saddles.

The northern states made a united effort to save the fortress. Bohemond was joined by Raymond ofTripolis. There were also with them contingents ofArmenian and Greek troops. The presence of such numbers added to the importance of the signal victory which Nureddin gained. Both Bohemond and Raymond were amongst the numerous prisoners. Within two days Harim was captured (12th August 1164)1 It had been the object of many attacks and was an important gain. The fortress guards the approach to Antioch on theway from Aleppo. As the Christian occupation of Atharib had once threatened the Moslem town, so now from Harim the Moslems threatened Antioch. Nureddin's next step might well have been an attack on Antioch itself. He was restrained from this by fear of the emperor Manuel. Greek troops had just been engaged against him, the emperor was friendly to the Latins, and there was a danger that he might occupy Antioch itself^ After an interval, therefore, he struck a blow at the frontiers of Jerusalem by laying siege to Banyas. There was a special reason for the selection of this point of attack. Shirkuh was hard pressed in Egypt just then, and Nureddin desired to effect a diversion in his favour^ The undertaking was successful in every respect. Shirkuh was relieved and the castle was captured after a few days siege (i8th October 1164)^ Amalric arrived from Egypt too late to render assistance.

The advance marked by the occupation of Banyas was recognised on the Latin side by the surrender of a portion of the revenues of Tiberias to secure peace. The scene of negotiations now changes to Antioch and Aleppo. Both Amalric and Nureddin left for the north. Nur- eddin's troops had just met with a reverse at the hands of the Armenian prince Thoros (October). Hehad invaded thedistrict of Mar'ash, defeated the army of Aleppo and made numerous prisoners. His demand that Nureddin should release the Ar- menian prisoners who were in his hands had previously been refused; now it was granted'. After this, in the early part of the summer of 1165, Bohemond also was released for a ransom. William ofTyre suggests two motives fear ofthe emperor, and : the consideration that Bohemond was so youthful as not to be a formidable enemy. Raymond of Tripolis was not released and Reginald of Chatillon continued still a prisoner. In 1 165 the onlyoperations against the Latins ofwhich there is a record were conducted by Shirkuh, who seems to have commanded the troops of Damascus^ Nureddin was probably in the north, and may have been at war with Kilij Arslan ibn Mas'ud of Iconium'. The year 1166 appears to be a complete blank in the original records^ Plans and preparations for a double campaign, in Egypt and in Syria, may have occupied Nureddin's attention. Shirkuh's experience in Egypt in 1164 had confirmed him in the view of the situation which he had urged on Nureddin before the expedition started. His expectations were not ex- tinguished, but rather kindled afresh. His attack had not been successful but he was confident it would be so if only it were persevered in. He persisted therefore in advocating another attempt, and Nureddin yielded to his representations'. Early ^ Michael i. 360. ' Tyrexix. 11.

Shirkuh set his nephew Saladin there as governor and returned to Upper Egypt where his earlier operations had been conducted. Neither before nor after this acquisition was anything decisive accomplished by either side. The siege of Alexandria by the allies dragged on for three months. Finally both Shirkuh and Amalric were glad to listen to Shawir's proposals for peace. The news of Nur- eddin's operations in Syria made the Latins anxious to retire. Both parties agreed to evacuate Egypt and both received an indemnity from the Egyptian treasury^. Alexandria was evacu- ated in the beginning of August.

Affairs on the Euphrates seem to have occupied his attention\\\\ In November important news came from Egypt. Amalric's ambition to be lord of Egypt had led to a change in the situation there. He was not content with the pay- ment of tribute by the Egyptian \\\"sultan\\\" ; he aimed at entire possession of the country. Although he requested help from the emperor Manuel and received a favourable answer he did not wait for the arrival of his Greek allies. We can only marvel at the folly of the whole undertaking. It could not fail to cast Egypt into the arms of Damascus^ Some, the Templars for instance, refused to join in the expedition because they dis- approved. The charges of faithlessness against Shawir were a mere excuse or rested on suspicion^ The Latin army set out towards the end ofOctober 1168. Bilbais was occupied without difficulty (3rd November)^ and the army turned against Cairo. It does not seem that the siege was pushed with much vigour. Time was spent in negotiations. At first they may have been~ sincere on Shawir's part^ He knew Shirkuh's temper and the danger of alliance with Nureddin. But in the end the negotia- tions were only a means of gaining time until relief should come. Nureddin was in Aleppo and Shirkuh in Homs when the caliph's request for help reached them®. It was the 17th of December before their troops were ready to start from Ras ^ Operations against Ja'bar, which was capturedin October, occupiedsome time (Beh. iii. 46, LA. i. 552f.).

The passage seems to be from LA., whose text in Recueil i. 554 gives ISt Safar as the date of the capture of the city (so LA. ii. 247). * Perhaps the actual decision of the caliph to ask Nureddin's help was not in accordance with the inclination of Shawir at the time (cf. A.S. iv. 138). Possibly he would have delayed somewhat longer before taking such a step. \\\" I.A. i. 557. S. c. 13198\",\"194 SHIRKUH'S CONQUEST OF EGYPT AD. 11 68-69 el-ma in the Hauran. When Amalric heard that Shirkuh was on the way he set out from Bilbais (25th December)*, with the intention of encountering him before he was joined by the Egyptians. His plan failed and the Latin king at once re- treated, taking with him the troops he had left to guard Bilbais (2nd January)*. It was a feeble ending to a foolish attempt; and yet perhaps it was well Amalric did not risk a battle. Shirkuh had with him 8000 of Nureddin's choicest troops and the Egyptians were his allies.

Shirkuh stepped into his place as the caliph's wazir and the real ruler of Egypt. Without a blow being struck a conquest was achieved which was to bring ruin on the Latin states. Shirkuh's service to the Moslem cause deserves to be written in letters of gold on the pages of history. Within twenty years of the occupation of Egypt the city of Jerusalem and almost all that had been Latin territory passed once more into Moslem hands. The final triumph was happily granted to one who was of Shirkuh's blood and owed his eleva- tion to the bold Kurdish leader who established the fortunes of his house. Shirkuh did not live long to enjoy the reward of his sagacity and his bravery. It is here,just after the crowning achievement of his life, that history must take leave of him. \\\"When they rejoice in what they have received, We take them away*.\\\" He was taken by his Lord on the 23rd of March 1169. Nureddin and the Moslem East owed much to him. He was a restless fighter all his days, farseeing and persistent in his plans and bold in the execution of them.

Years after, in the mood ofa man who feels that he has been in the hands of destiny, Saladin told his intimates how entirely against his inclination he accompanied Shirkuh on his third campaign^ Being on the spot,however, he was marked out for promotion by his relationship to the Syrian leader and by the prominent and successful part he had already played in his service. The title El-malik en-nasir, the conquer- ing prince, conferred upon him by the caliph was not an empty compliment, it was justified by the promise and the fulfilment of the past. He was about 32 years of age and fitted for his new position by all his previous training and experience. His capacity had been shown in the second^ and the third at least of the expeditions against Egypt^ Ibn el-athir's statement that he was chosen bythe caliph because he was the youngest and so probably the weakest of the Syrian emirs cannot shake these facts. Modern historians have combined the statement with the incident of Saladin's unwillingness to accompany Shirkuh on this third expedition and inferred quite unwarrantably that his character hitherto had been effeminated Doubtless he lacked devotion to Shirkuh's Egyptian policy. But the very fact that Nureddin and Shirkuh required him to join in the third cam- paign is a testimony to his worth.

The caliph's \\\"choice\\\" was morenominal than real. Saladin's character is to be read in the decisive measures which he took to secure his position. The caliph and his favourites cherished hopes that the new master set over them might not possess the ability of his predecessor. Enmity also was stirred by Saladin's policy of transferring important offices from the Egyptians to the Syrians. Communications were ex- changed with Amalric and schemes of revolt were planned. When Saladin discovered the plot and executed the prime mover in it, the caliph was reduced to humble obedience (be- ginning of August). He was compelled to remain a puppet whose sovereignty was merely nominal. In this same year the Latins made their only attempt to dis- possess the new wazir and Saladin again showed himselfworthy of his position. The assistance which the emperor Manuel had promised to the ill-fated expedition of the previous year was at length available. The fleet which he sent numbered 200 sail. But the impetuosity of the Latins had changed to timidity and sluggishness. Delay followed delay and weeks passed before Amalric's forces were ready, in the middle of October. It was decided to besiege Damietta. Already the stores of the Greek ships were running down. The season of the year was unfavourable. Saladin had been allowed ample time to make his preparations. The Latinsdisplayed insufficient energyand the siege dragged on for fifty days and then came to an inglorious end^ Greeks and Latins blamed one another for the failure. From now Amalric restricted himselfto the defence of his own territories. Gilbert d'Assailly was discredited. The attack on Egypt had failed. Saladin was its master. The immediate effect ofthe Syrian occupation of Egypt was less prejudicial to the Latins than it might have been, because of the policy which Saladin adopted for his own personal ad- vantage. If Egypt had been under Nureddin's complete con- trol Jerusalem would now have been exposed to a crushing attack on two sides at once. But Saladin aimed from the first ' Tyrexx. 17 says \\\"occultis quibusdam conditionibus foedus initur.\\\" Michael i. 370saysthatSaladincontinuedforatimeto paythe Egyptian tribute.201\",\"A.D. 1169-70 EGYPT UNDER SALAH ED-DIN YUSUF 197 at independent sovereigntyand closeco-operation withNureddin was apt to injure his prospects. In all probability his plans were a continuation ofthose of his uncle Shirkuh and embodied the ambition ofhis family, for he was supported strenuously by his father Ayub who joined him in Egypt early in 1170. His policy towards the caliph and towards Nureddin is to be under- stood in the light of his intention to found an independent dynasty. The Egyptian caliph, although he was a Fatimite and al- though the Syrians acknowledged the caliph of Bagdad, was allowed by Saladin to retain his nominal position for two years and a half. It would have been hazardous to depose him. The step was too apt to rouse the religious and national feeling of Egypt. So at least Saladin replied when Nureddin urged him to satisfy the demands of orthodoxy. There may have been another reason, as Ibn el-athir suggests^ The caliph was actu- 1 ally a support to Saladin's position and capable of rallying help ' in Egypt ifit became necessaryto measure arms with Nureddin. In September 1171 there was an agitationwhichbroughtmatters to a crisis. Fortunately at that moment the caliph died (13th September). Next Friday public prayers in the mosques were said in the nameofthecaliphofBagdad. Saladin'spositionwas much stronger bythis time,and the change appearstohavebeen accepted with wonderful quietness. After this event Saladin's only nominal superior was Nur- eddin. The young emir postponed an open breach as long as possible. He did not covet the name of independence, when he had the reality. Nureddin regarded Saladin, of course, as an officer of his in charge of Egypt. His letters were significantly addressedto\\\"Salahed-dinandalltheemirsinEgypt.\\\" Shirkuh's nephew was one amongst a number ofsubordinates. Butgradu- ally Saladin's policy became unmistakable. He avoided even meeting his former lord. Nureddin found that he did not co-operate heartily against the Latins nor show any zeal in breaking down the barrier which lay between Egypt and Damascus. In the year before Nureddin's death the situation could be disguised no longer. It was clear that Saladin would 1 LA. i. 578f.202\",\"198 NUR ED-DIN MAHMUD A.D. 1169-7O yield to force only. Nureddin was preparing for war when he died in July 1174. The last period ofhis life extends from 1169 to 1174. During 1169 Nureddin's attention was occupied by the course of affairs in Egypt He loyally supported Saladin by sending him reinforcements when he was threatened by con- spiracy in the summer and by the Greek and Latin alliance in the autumn and winter. At the same time he created a diversion in his favour by raiding Latin territory*. Only one aggressive movement of the Latins is recorded, on the borders of Tripolis in December 1169 or January of the following year-*. When Saladin was firmly established Nureddin naturally expected that he would act with him in concert against the Latins ofJerusalem. The dispatch ofAyub to Egypt in March II70^at Saladin's request, is probably evidence that Nureddin was quite unsuspicious of rivalry at that date*. To the east and south of the Dead Sea were a number of Latin castles which seriouslydisturbed communication with Egypt. These he decided should be destroyed in the first place. When Ayub's caravan was passing through the danger zone Nureddin acted as his escort. Afterwards,on the 20thofApril^ he left his camp at Ras el-ma to undertake the siege of Kerak\\\", one of the castles in the district. His attack lasted four days only. Being threatened by a reliefforce he advanced against it. The Latins retired without offering battle and Nureddin then withdrew to pass the month of Ramadan in his own territory.

Nureddin remained in the Hauran until the end of June, when news came that a severe earthquake had caused extensive damage in the north. Ruined towns had to be re- paired and measures taken to secure them against surprise. But the Latins were equally affected, and neither side was free to attack the other. The shocks continued at intervals for three or four months^ A new distraction presented itself before they ceased. Nureddin's brother Kutb ed-din of Mosul died on the 6th of September^ Nureddin was just then at Tell bashir and he immediately started to secure his brother's inheritance. In this he was most successful. Some of the towns he occupied he retained. Others he left to his nephew, Saifed-din Gazi II, who succeeded Kutb ed-din in Mosul, and acknowledged Nureddin's overlordship. These affairs occupied the sultan until the spring of the following year''. In the beginning of December 1170, Nureddin being in the north, Saladin made an attack on the south-western territory of Jerusalem. The invasion lasted only a few days. Darum was besieged. It was a small castle built a few years previously by Amalric in the neighbourhood of Gaza, of ruins found there. Amalrichimselfadvanced to its relief. Saladin took the aggres- sive but was beaten off. Then he made a dash against Gaza and destroyed its suburbs. After that he returned to Egypt'. In the same month after a brief interval an expedition was sent by Saladin against the seaport of Aila on the Red Sea. The town was captured in the third week of December^ Amalric was now thoroughly alarmed by the situation. His two enemies were striking at him from opposite sides.

He was absent from his kingdom from March to June. During that time there seems to have been no actual attack by either of the Moslem leaders.

He was drawn for a moment in another direction byan incident which happened on the coast of Antioch in September'. Two Egyptian merchantmen were seized at Laodicea in violation of an existing truce. Nureddin retaliated by incursions into the territories of Antioch and Tripolis. He himself accompanied the troops which entered Tripolis. The country was raided and full advantage doubtless taken of the fact that its castles had suffered severely from the earthquakes of the preceding year*. It does not, however, appear certain that any permanent acquisitions were made'. Ibn el-athir\\\" notes that after this date Nureddin established a pigeon-post throughout Syria by which he might at once receive news of impending attacks from the borders. But the use of carrier pigeons is frequently referred to before this date. These operations cannot have lasted long and may not have been distinguished by the Latins from the forays to which they * InTyrexx. 24the 7thyear of Amalric'sreign, butthenarrativeofthe7thyear commenceswithxx. 19andthisis \\\"thefollowing year.\\\" Seeappendix. « Tyre xx. 17. • The date is inferred from Beh. iii. 53 who says 'Arkawastaken in Muharram 567,whichends3rd Octolier.

In 1171, as in the preceding year, Saladin made his attack on the Latins when Nureddin was safely occupied in the north. In response to Nureddin's representations he laid siege to one of the castles by the Dead Sea, Shaubak or Mont Royal. He started from Cairo on September 25th^ Nureddin was over- joyed and hastened to join his lieutenant. But Saladin did not await his arrival.

II7I-73 position of affairs may be inferred from the fact that Saladin and his advisers discussed the expediency of revolt. Their decision was to avoid an open breach' and Saladin sent the most solemn assurances of good faith and sincerity to his nominal lord. Nureddin professed to be satisfied. He had received no doubt promises of earnest co-operation against the Latins. Information about the events of 1172 is very indefinite. It leaves the impression however that Saladin devised occupations in Egypt and persisted in avoiding compliance with Nureddin's wishes. Nureddin, on his part, at least during the latter part of the summer, was in the Hauran' obviously prepared to attack the castles by the Dead Sea and desirous of so doing. In October or November' the Latins made an incursion into the Hauran but they did not face an engagement with Nureddin. On the other side a Moslem expedition into the district of Tiberias secured a large amount ofplunder. If Saladin actually spent a few days this year in again attacking Shaubak his half- heartedness must only have exasperated the relations between himself and Nureddin. But the evidence that he did so is uncertain*. In 1173 Nureddin was involved in war with Kilij Arslan. He was engaged in the quarrel of his ally the ruler of Malatiya. This occupied him during the greater part of June and July'. * In I.A. i. 582f. Ayub is represented as a strong advocate of this policy.

Amalric posted himself on the hills to the west of the Dead Sea. His aid was not required for the relief of the castle. Just as in 1171 Nureddin's approach was sufficient to bring about Saladin's retreat. The inference was unmistakable. Nureddin was not deceived by the excuse that Ayub was ill. He withdrew to make preparations for war with his disobedient vassal. It is idle to speculate what might have been the result of the conflict. Saladin was never called upon to measure his strength with that ofhis great rival and nominal lord. Nureddin died at Damascus in the month of May 1174. He was 56 years ofage^. There were domestic troubles in Egypt and a foreign invasion in 1174, which would have been a serious complication in Saladin's position had Nureddin still been alive. They originated in a conspiracy to restore the Fatimite caliph. The danger did not end with the execution of the principal con- spirators (6th April)^. The Latins had been invited to give their assistance. Those of Jerusalem did not move when they heard of the failure of the plot but a fleet from Sicily attacked Alexandria some months later.

II74 days the Moslems took the offensive and many of the enemies' siege engines were burned (Tuesday). On Wednesday the sallies from the town were continued. In the afternoon news arrived that Saladin was advancing. This encourr.ged the Alexandrians to sally out in the darkness. The Latins were completely routed and next morning they sailed away. There was still an actual revolt to deal with. One of the discontented emirs established himself at Aswan (Assouan). He was defeated on September 7th by a force under the * command of one of the sultan's brothers, El-malik el-*adil Saif ed-din. Saladin was now ready to enter on Nureddin's inheritance in Syria and affairs there were soon ripe for his interference. Although he had been so lately just on the point of rebellion it was to him that Nureddin's princedom now passed and by him that Nureddin's mission in the holy war fell to be continued and triumphantly completed. * 7th Safar 570 (Beh. iii. 57).209\",\"207 whom \\\"vas CHAPTER V. SALAH ED-DIN YUSUF. Amongst Nureddin's most distinguished emirs were two brothers of Kurdish extraction and probably of humble origin, Nejm ed-din Ayub and Asad ed-din Shirkuh. They were the father and the uncle, respectively, of Salah ed-din Yusuf. Having all the advantage of their training and example and being still more highly gifted than they, Saladin owed to them also the splendid opportunities of his first emirate. The history of Shirkuh's conquest of Egypt and of Saladin's succession to his uncle's position has been narrated in chapter IV. Saladin was already 32 years of age. His recent close association with Shirkuh in the execution of his schemes must have saved him from many mistakes. It may in fact be assumed that he inherited the policy as well as the position of his farseeing kinsman. For some years longer he enjoyed the benefit of his father's counsels (1170-73). When Nureddin died in 1174 Saladin was fully equipped by his past experience for the tasks and opportunities which presented themselves. Although up to this time his aim had simply been to retain his hold on Egypt without sacrificing his independence of Nureddin, this did not exhaust his ambition nor exclude much wider hopes for the future. According to his own assertion he was resolved to re- conquer Syria from the Latins and cherished the beliefthat God had chosen him to be an instrument in the deliverance of Jeru- salem. Even this intention was only part of a wider plan. He regarded all Latin Syria and all Nureddin's dominions as his proper inheritance. His action after Nureddin's death needs no defence. He was the ablest and the most powerful of the late210\",\"204 SALAH ED-DIN YUSUF days tfs emirs. Without his interference Nureddin's dominions sipjuld simply have fallen to pieces. He wrote to the caliph practically claiming to be the sultan's successor and announcing that as such he would take possession of Latin Syria also. These projects were not easily realised. Thirteen years passed before Saladin was fully master even of Nureddin's possessions. During that period the Latins escaped the full brunt of his attack. Twice at least he commenced the Latin war only to draw back until a more favourable opportunity should present itself But he never lost sight of the goal he had set before him and in the end he accomplished his double purpose. The conquest of Damascus and of a large part of Syria was easily achieved in the years 1174-76. After this Saladin seems to have thought that he might try conclusions with the Latins, but a severe check at Ramla warned him not to be precipitate (1177). Some later conflicts with the Latins were more suc- cessful (1179) and vindicated the new sultan's superiority over them, although Moslem wars still occupied most of his time (1180-81). Even in 1182 when Saladin again invaded Palestine other schemes divided his attention. It was only now that Aleppo and the remnants of Nureddin's former dominions in Mesopotamia were added to his sultanate. This accomplished he judged that at length the time had come for a strenuous attack on the Latin states (i183). But again after a year and a half of successful warfare the situation in Mesopotamia became such that the attack in the south had to be relinquished. Peace was concluded for four years (1185). A shorter period would have sufficed and the Latins actually broke their treaty in 1187. Saladin was now prepared to devote himselfentirely to the holy war. It was the most glorious part of his career. In two brief years the Latin power crumbled everywhere before his attack. Then came the \\\"third crusade\\\" and the long struggle which imperilled all his victories (1189-92). The crisis passed and left him again substantially victorious. Peace was made with Richard of England in September 1192. In the following March the great sultan's death took place. It is not difficult to name the qualities which contributed most to the success of Saladin's career. In the execution of his211\",\"SALAH ED-DIN YUSUF 20/ schemes he needed to make use ofsubordinate emirs overwhom his authority was by no means absolute. Probably he was helped by a persuasive manner, certainly he possessed in a high degree the gifts of conciliation and tact. He quickly gauged the strength of any opposition to his plans and did not hesitate to make sacrifices for the sake of the best attainable. His own untiring energy and perseverance were striking features in his character. He never spared himself in the accomplish- ment of his plans and he never seemed to lose heart in the face of adverse circumstances. His judgments were sound and he struck decisively when once he had resolved on a course of action. These qualities served him well both as a statesman and a soldier. In conversation with one of his .sons a few months before his death Saladin sought to impress upon him some of the principles which had animated his own career. *' Fear God,\\\" he said, \\\"for that is the beginning of all prosperity and do what God commands, for He will be the cause of your success. Abstain from shedding blood, much or little, for blood never sleeps. Keep the affections of your subjects and watch over their affairs for you are a steward of mine and of God over them. Keep the affections of the emirs, the ministers and the nobles, for I have accomplished what I have by conciliation and tact. Do not cherish hate towards anyone, for death is sure. Guard your relations with men, for God does not pardon except they are propitiated.\\\" These words express a character as well as a policy. Saladin had none of the elements of the tyrant in his nature. He never stood on his dignity, he was extremely courteous toguests and strangersandhemadehimselfpopularby his lavish generosity although he himselfHved and dressed most simply. He was accessible to his subjects and always ready to hear their complaints. He was chivalrous in the sense that he was quickly touched tocompassion bytheweak and the helpless and readily moved to generous actions. He was certainly humane although quite destitute of that abstract respect for human life which now prevails so widely. His execution of the knights Templars after the battle of Hattin is a notable example of his treatment of obnoxious enemies. But Saladin was not ruthless in war and he always kept his promises. His212\",\"2o8 SALAH ED-DIN YUSUF A.D.I 174 mildness often tempered what strict justice would have per- mitted. He was not lacking in culture, being well informed and having the interest of the educated man in many things. He was not so pious, probably, as Nureddin, but he supported religi(^ and patronised its devotees. He trusted in providence and sought to shape his life in accordance with the divine will. He was punctual in the discharge ofhis religious duties and his devotion to God's service in the holy war was no doubt sincere. Altogether he compares most favourably with the kings of France a»d England who led the third crusade. Christendom did not excel Islam in the type ofthe heroes whom it nurtured. Nureddin left an heir in the person of his son El-malik es-salih Isma'il, a boy 11 years old. He was proclaimed sultan by the various governors of his father's cities. Even Saladin acknowledged his position. But he was simply a puppet in the hands of those who had him in their power. At his father's death (15th May 1174) he was in Damascus and so under control of the emirs there. At their head was Shams ed-din Muhammed ibn el-mukaddem. But the governor of Aleppo, Shams ed-din 'Ali ibn ed-daya, brother of Mejd ed-din, wished to have the young prince to oppose to the pretensions of Saif- eddin of Mosul, son of Kutb ed-din and Nureddin's nephew'. Sa'ad ed-din Kumushtakin was his emissary to the emirs of Damascus. After some negotiations and fighting they allowed him to take Es-salih to Aleppo. Possibly they hoped that Kumushtakin had become their agent. When he reached Aleppo he deposed Ibn ed-daya (3rd August)^ and then pro- ceeded to act as ruler of Aleppo, and sole guardian of the young prince. In this way things did not turn out as Ibn el-mukaddem desired. Being now afraid of Kumushtakin the emirs of Damascus wrote to Saifeddin of Mosul offering him their city, and when he made no response they repeated the offer to Saladin of Egypt^ This was Saladin's opportunity. He had already prepared his way by letters and dispatches. His delay in Egypt was * Kem. Blochet 5i=iii. 559. ' Bch. iii. 58 (md Muharram 570). ' Kem.

He set out for Damascus pro- fessing the most disinterested motives. He came, he said, to help Es-salih against Saifeddin of Mosul who was depriving the rightful heirofhis inheritance. He claimed to be the proper guardian of Nureddin's son and said it was only the sudden death ofthe late sultan which had prevented his formal nomina- tor!.

Meantime they remained within the shelter of their walls and gave Saladin no opportunity ofstriking a blow in the open field.

It is perhaps significant that 'Ezaz was restored to Aleppo although the historian tells the pretty story that it was a gallant present made to Es-salih's sister. She was asked by the sultan what present he could give her. She had been taught beforehand and said •*the castle of'Ezaz^\\\" During the siege of 'Ezaz the Assassins had made a second attempt on Saladin's life. In consequence he now attacked their settlements in the Jebel Ansariya, to the west of the Orontes valley'. Masyaf their principal stronghold was besieged for a week. But their position was strong and they were dangerous enemies to provoke. Besides Turan shah, Saladin's brother, just then suffered a reverse at the hands of the Latins in the Bika* (beginning of August). So a promise ofsubmission was readily accepted from the Assassins^ After this Saladin remained in Syria less than a month.

Amalric, indeed, as soon as he heard of Nureddin's death assembled his forces and besieged Banyas. After fifteen days however he accepted the terms offered him by Ibn el-mukaddem of Damascus, the payment of a sum of money and the release of certain captives*. It was now the early part of June, before the I4thl The king was indisposed and this perhaps decided him to discontinue his attack. His illness lasted some weeks. He died on the nth ofJuly^ and his death was a great misfortune for the Latins. Baldwin IV, his son and successor, was a boytwelve years old and a leper. Thestruggles for the possession of Es-salih, the boy prince over the border, were paralleled by the jealousy and the contests of the Latin chiefs. But amongst them there was no strong man able to reduce the others to submission. In autumn, after the assassi- nation of the first regent, Milo of Plancy, Raymond III of Tripolis became the young king's guardian. He had been released after nine years captivity* on payment of a ransom shortly before Nureddin's deaths He was responsible for the part the Latins played during Saladin's campaign in 117$. His leadership was culpably weak. In December 1174 the Latins of Jerusalem saw that if they were to strike a blow against Saladin it must be at once before his position was secured by further success.

II75-76 put under Raymond's command about the beginning ofJanuary with the intention that he should attack Saladin from the side ofTripoh's. For four precious months while Saladin was making progress every day, Raymond did practically nothing. If his army was weak he ought to have strengthened it. He spent time in foolish bargaining with Saladin's enemies instead of making them his allies on any terms. He made timid move- ments here and there until his best opportunities were past. Then he made peace for the release of some captives and the payment of a sum of money. During the same time, in the harvest season, an expedition from Jerusalem spent a few days plundering the territory of Damascus. They advanced as far as Dariya, four miles from Damascus. Then they returned, and when Saladin came south it was the Latins who proposed a truce. Saladin could have desired nothing morefavourableto his plans. It is interesting to note that in the end of 1174 William of Tyre became chancellor and in June 1175 he was consecrated archbishop ofTyre^ During the summer of 1176 there seems to have been some co-operation between Antioch and Aleppo against Saladin. But no particulars are recorded and it does not appear to have been very effective'. The year is specially notable because of the reappearance of a Latin chief who had spent fifteen years and a half in a Moslem prison. It was Reginald of Chatillon. He owed his release to the temporary friendship between Antioch and Aleppo'. Since Bohemond III was now prince of Antioch Reginald went south toJerusalem and there soon rose to promi- nence.

In thesummerofthissameyearanexpedition was planned which probably was Reginald's first opportunity of avenging his long imprisonment. It was a mere raid into the Bika' and lasted only a few days (beginning ofAugust)\\\\ There were two parties. One consisting of the forces of Jerusalem started from Sidon, crossed the hills of Lebanon and spread devastation in the southern part ofthe Bika' round 'Ainjar^. It was joined by Raymond ofTripolis, who started from Jubail and entered the Bika' by way of Munaitera. Shams ed-daula Turan shah had just returned in July from a prolonged absence in Yemen and he led the troops of Damascus against the invaders^ The Latins drove him off and then separated to return home. It was probably on their way home that a party of them was defeated by Ibn el-mukaddem of Ba'albek. Between the eastern and the western accounts it is not easy to decide whether this Moslem success reallycounterbalanced the result ofthe previous engagements Baldwin's weak state of health made it imperative that a successor should be provided without delay. It was resolved accordinglyto invite William ofMontferrat to come to Palestine (1175). He landed in Sidon in the beginning of October 1176 and six weeks afterwards married Baldwin's sister Sybil. Three months later William himself became ill and he died in the followingJune (1177).

About this time the emperor Manuel senta fleetof 70galleys to co-operate with the Latins in an attack on Egypt. An agree- ment had been made to this eflectsome time previously. It was anticipated that Philip of Flanders would assist the expedition. He landed in *Akka in August with large forces and was joyfully received. He was offered practically the regencyofthe kingdom but refused. His conduct soon met with disapproval. He raised the question of Sybil's remarriage to one of his knights and objected to the continuance of Reginald's procuratorship. Finally he refused to take part in the Egyptian expedition. As a result of his opposition the Greeks were told that nothing could be done until the following April. This meant giving up the expedition altogether. From the battle of Myrokephalon (i176) until his death in 1 180 Manuel was fully engaged in wars ofhisown against thesultan of Iconium. Philipdesired however to undertake some enterprise and when it was proposed to attack the Moslems on the borders of Antioch or Tripolis he agreed. There was a truce in force but the terms expressly provided that the Latins might declare itat an end on the arrival of any crusading prince from the west^ Baldwin sent troops from Jerusalem to co-operate, and from Tripolis a descent was made on the valley of the Orontes. Hama was attacked on the 14th of November\\\". But the allies remained there only four days*. They received news which seemed to promise them speedy success if they attacked Harim. The intrigues in Aleppo against Sa'ad ed-din Kumushtakin had induced E.s- salih to arrest him and assert for himself a more independent position.

He was well aware ofthe Latin plans to invade that country with the assistance of theGreeksandhewaspreparedtoresisttheirattack. Towardsthe end ofthe year, after he received news that the Latins were en- gaged in the north, he madean incursion into southern Palestine to effect a diversion. On the 23rd ofNovember^ while the siege of Harim was in progress he arrived before Ascalon. The king had entered the citya fewdays previously with forces whichhad been collected to resist the invasion. The knights Templars were for the most part in Gaza. As the Latins did not venture to attack next day (24th November), the Moslems scattered in bands over the country. Ramla, which was deserted, was burned. In Jerusalem preparations were made for retreat into the citadel in case of need. The Moslems felt perfectly secure. On the 25th'* the king, seeing his opportunity, came out from Ascalon. After he was joined by eighty Templars the Latin knights numbered three hundred and seventy-five and the foot-soldiers were correspondingly numerous. They came upon Saladin's main body while it was crossing a stream and obstructed in its movements by the baggage^ The Moslems were already in confusion and were easily routed.

Some time later Ibn el-mukaddem accepted Kafr tab and several places in its neigh- bourhood in exchange for Ba'albek^ The town was handed over to Turan shah\\\\ The Latins of Jerusalem still hoped for an opportunity of attacking Egypt but they were not sufficiently strong'. The building ofCastle Jacobs by the Jordan north of Lake Tiberias, was their only undertaking of importance this year. Perhaps the troops of Damascus had harassed the Latins from Banyas and Damascus although Saladin was absent in the north. In any case the Latins had reason to be apprehensive because of the weakness of their northern border. It would have been a bolder policy to attempt the recovery of Banyas. But the site ofthe new castle was well chosen for its purpose. It was built just beside a ford on the Jordan known as Jacob's ford. It guarded the sea road from Damascus, the via maris,along which the Moslem invaders swept westward to harry the lowlands of Galilee. From it also a watch could be kept on the horsemen who came from Banyas down the open Jordan valley. It was a considerable undertaking.

Soonafterwardsthepresenceoflargeflocks in the neighbourhood of Banyas tempted the Latins to make an expedition. They marched by night in the hope of effecting a surprise. But their preparations had been made on such a scale that the Moslems were well aware of their approach. The sultan's nephew, *Izz ed-din Ferukh shah, was ordered to watch their movements at the head of the troops of Damascus. His instructions were not to engage the enemy until they had advanced well into Moslem territory. His advance guard how- ever drew him into a general engagement and he gained a brilliant victory (loth April 1179). King Baldwin was with the army and during the fight was in great peril. He was saved by the devotion ofhis followers, notably of Humphrey, constable of the kingdom. Humphrey's wounds were so severe that he died twelve days later at Castle Jacob (22nd April)^ These events drew Saladin again into war with the Latins. It appears that he offered them 60,000 dinars on condition that theyshould destroy Castle Jacob,and that when they refused this offer he increased it to 100,000 dinars'. Such offers can only be explained on the hypothesis that Saladin would have preferred to pursue his plans elsewhere as long as the Latins remained inactive. But he judged it unwise to allow them to strengthen their position as they were attempting to do. From the end of May* through all the summer he engaged in hostilities against them. He took up his quarters at Banyas and from there his troops made incursions in every direction. They penetrated westward as far as Sidon and Beirut as well as southwards.

Il8o GUY OF LUSIGNAN 223 Antioch had long ceased to be the most important of the Latin states. In 11 80 an event took place which was the beginning of much evil in the history of Jerusalem. Baldwin's sister Sybil and her son were still the nearest heirs to the kingdom. The proposals for Sybil's remarriage had come tonothing. Suddenly in Lent, contrary to all custom, she was married in haste to Guy of Lusignan. Sybil was only 21 years ofage and the marriage was in accordance with her wish. Yet it was an unfortunate choice for the kingdom. Guy was a knight of no particular ability and with nothing substantial to recommend him, since good looks will not save a kingdom. Many were alienated, and particularly Raymond of Tripolis. An opposition party was created. Raymond kept away from Jerusalem altogether during the next two years and when he announced his intention ofvisiting Tiberias in 1182 the king at first forbade his coming^ The incident exemplifies the attitude of the parties to one another. Such occurrences embittered feeling and kept alive old jealousies^ The schism continued to work its evil effects until the kingdom was overthrown. During the remainder of 1180 Saladin occupied himself in northern Syria. It does not appear that the death of Saif ed-din Gazi of Mosul on the 29th of June had any influence on his doings. Another brother, *Izz ed-din Mas'ud, succeeded him. Es-salih of Aleppo still continued to hold his precarious posi- tion^ but Ra'ban and the district round was Saladin's possession and this was threatened by the extending power of Kilij Arslan of Rum. In the summer of 1179 there had been a battle in which Taki ed-din 'Omar commanded Saladin's armyand gained a victory*. But negotiations more than fighting now occupied ^ Tyre xxii. 9. 2 Makrizi viii. 545, without an exact date but apparently referring to the end of Dhu'l-ka'da 577 (ist week of April 1182), says that Saladin concluded a treaty in Egyptwith anenvoyofthe count of Tripolis. Possiblythis agreementwasadirect resultofthequarrel spoken of above. It maybe noted,however, that Makrizi says nothing of Raymond's treaty with Saladin in June 1180. Raymond joined in the operationsagainst Saladinin May (Tyrexxii. 14). 3 Beh. iii. 64f. * Aboutthetimewhen CastleJacobwasdestroyed(I.A.i.639f.).228\",\"224 SALAH ED-DIN YUSUF A.D. II80-81 Saladin. Peace was made on the 2nd of October (1180)'. In the month following he led an expedition against Rupen the Armenian. Peace with him was made in November*. Saladin on his waysouth reached Hama towards the 20th ofthe month'. In January 1181 Saladin returned to Egypt. He remained there until May 1182. It was the last visit which he paid to Egypt*. During the years which follow, until his death, he was occupied with little intermission in the Latin war. It is note- worthy that during this year in Egypt he pushed on a scheme of great fortifications round Alexandria. He apprehended an attack from Europe at this point and was resolved to be pre- pared. His peace with the emperor Alexius II in the autumn of 1 181' was a guarantee that no Greek fleet would assist in the attack. From this time onwards his relations with the Greeks were friendly. While thus occupied Saladin was hopeful that he might be able to join in the next pilgrimage to Mekka (April 1182). His plans in this respect were frustrated. The truce with the Latins was broken before the appointed time expired. Each side accuses the other of breach of faith. Perhaps the doings of Reginald of Chatillon, governor of Kerak, were the first and chief cause of the rupture. His position commanded the caravan road between Syria and Egypt and he made the way insecure for travellers\\\". About the commencement of December 1181^ he went so far as to plan an expedition into Arabia. He was closely tracked by *Izz ed-din and the troops of Damascus and compelled to return without having accom- plished anything of consequence.

So both sides felt themselves aggrieved. Saladin had other reasons for returning to Syria in the beginning of 1182, but retaliation on the Latins was one of the objects he had in view and this guided his first movements. The sultan left Cairo on the nth of May and reached Damascus on the 22nd ofJune^ Many merchants and civilians were glad of the convoy and accompanied him. These made the march slower than usual. Besides,dread ofthe occupants of the castles by the Dead Sea imposed precaution and led to the choice of a circuitous route. Reginald was soon informed of Saladin's approach and persuaded the king to endeavour to intercept him. It is said that the enterprise was mismanaged^ and certainly the Moslem caravan reached Damascus quite unharmed. Moreover the absence of the army of Jerusalem ^ Tyre xxii. 14.

II82 had left its territories defenceless and given 'Izz ed-din of Damascus his opportunity. It is not said whether he crossed the Jordan to the north or to the south of lake Tiberias. Either way led to the district round Tiberias and the great central plain Marj ibn 'Ammar which were traversed and ravaged by his troops. Even the neighbourhood of 'Akka was reached and the little town of Daburiya on the northern extremity of the plain was plundered. On the way back the cliff fortress of Habis Jaldek was captured'. It was one of the few strongholds which the Latins still held in the district of Suwad east of the Jordan'. It was taken by storm within five days of the first attack and many believed that the loss was due to treachery. When Saladin reached Damascus his nephew was able to report this capture and also that he had found his way to the very heart of the enemy's country. It was decided to repeat the attack at once on a larger scale. When the Latins at Petra found that Saladin had slipped past them they hurried back and took up their position at Saffuriya. The spot was well chosen. From it they could ad- vance to meet attack by whichever way the enemy approached from Damascus by the road from Banyas, by the \\\"sea road\\\" ; north ofTiberias, or through the Wadi Jalut past Baisan. They were often to meet there in the hurrying years that follow. They were not mistaken in thinking that Saladin would attack them now. His nephew's experience drew him on. Some weeks later he crossed the Jordan south of lake Tiberias and encamped before the city of that name on the night of the 19th of July*. From there detachments were sent in various direc- tions.

As he left the south, accordingly, he covered his departure and alarmed the Latins by a movement in another quarter. In the Bika' he learned that the Egyptian fleet had fulfilled his instructions to attack the coasf* and was now lying before Beirut. He moved at once in the same direction, laid waste the district round and eventhreatened the town itself (beginning of August)^ On the evening of the third day he retired satisfied with the alarm he had caused^. The movement had indeed been sufficiently alarming. After the battle ofKaukab the Latins in uncertainty fell back on Saffuriya. When they heard of the attack on Beirut they marched at once to its relief and a fleet was fitted out in Tyre. Then came the news that Saladin was gone and after this the Latin army dispersed.

The Egyptian fleet was troublesome, especially in the spring of 1183 when the pilgrim season came again. El-'adil was governor of Egypt but in that direction neither side was very active^ The Latins regarded Saladin's absence as giving them a favourable opportunity for operations against the territories of Damascus. They felt in- sulted, indeed, as William of Tyre the chancellor of the king- dom expresses it, that he should have gone away without first making a truce with them. It was a mark of contempt for their power which they desired to show was unmerited. In September *Izz ed-din of Damascus died and was replaced by Shams ed-din ibn el-mukaddem\\\"^. Possibly it was after this that their first expedition was made. It was against the district of Bosra and was merely a plundering raid. Moslem horsemen watched their movements but did not attack them\\\\ On the way back they besieged Habis Jaldek in the Suwad and re- A captured it within threeweeks (October)*. second expedition, in December, before Christmas, consisted only of mounted men. They crossed Jacob's ford and advanced towards Damascus. Theyreached Dariya and from there inflicted what damage they could. But the troops of Damascus were stationed in front of the orchards and Moslem horsemen swept round and round the camp cutting off stragglers, so that finally the Latins turned back from this point\\\". Reginald of Kerak won the credit of conceiving a more daring and effective plan. He built ships and had them transported on camel-back to the Red Sea. There he divided his expedition. The Moslem garrison of Aila had caused him considerable annoyance. He therefore left two ships and part of his forces to attempt the capture of the town. The rest of the expedition sailed south to attack the holy cities of Arabia. El-'adil sent ships from Egypt in pursuit of them.

After being pursued and harassed for some days they finally succeeded in escaping northwards. Meantime Saladin was adding to his dominions those parts of Nureddin's sultanate which had hitherto remained in other hands. On the 4th of December 1181^ El-malik es-salih had died. Saladin was then in Egypt and lamented his absence from Syria at such a crisis, for he claimed that he was the only rightful heir. In spite of his protests Aleppo passed into the hands ofTzz ed-din of Mosul. On the 27th of February of the following year (1182), however, that prince agreed to hand it over to his brother, 'Imad ed-din^ This roused Saladin's hopes afresh, for he had now a less formidable rival to deal with. When he left Egypt in May 1182 the conquest of Aleppo was what he principally had in view. He announced to the caliph that his purpose was to engage in the holy war, and he did actively devote himselffor a time to this end. The opportunity was good and he did not allow it to pass. But he furthered thereby his ulterior plan also, for his zeal commended all his interests to the caliph. His main object for the moment was revealed when he proceeded north in the end of August. He passed Aleppo on the 22nd of September^ marching slowly towards the Euphrates, for he was negotiating all the time with the caliph and the emirs of Mesopotamia^ His intention was to strike first at Mosul rather than Aleppo. Throughout the winter of 1182-83 he made continuous if not rapid progress and when he turned back to Syria a long list of conquered cities stood to the credit of his victories^ He laid siege to Aleppo ^ Shawal578, commencing28thJanuary('Imaded-dininA.S.iv. ^so).

But his own deepest desires also drew him to the enterprise. Success was not a foregone conclusion, yet the promise of victory was bright. Even the united power of the Latins was inferior to his resources. If Europe allowed him time success was almost certain. It is a superficial view, how- ever, that brands the Latins of the period as a degenerate race. The charge of degeneracy brought against them by William of Tyre, laudator teinporis acti, has become a commonplace of the historians who follow his guidance. But in the actual struggle there was no falling off in the valour and the zeal that were displayed. The knights fought as bravely as ever. They were still the devoted soldiers of the Cross, whose \\\"precious wood\\\" they carried into battle even more constantly than of old. There was disunion, indeed, amongst them, and want of com- petent leadership hurried them to their ruin. But when were these blemishes ever wanting in their history? The faction and the strife that paralysed their efforts had been there from the beginning. Some of their leaders, at least, were probably equal to those who had led them to victory in times past. Yet the situation was greatly changed. ->They had now an enemy who was sure to take advantage of their dissensions and their mistakes the Moslems were stronger and more united than ; thej/^had ever been_beforel The Latins, in short, were too few for the enemy they had to encounter. Their power to offer a permanent resistance to Saladin's attack depended on the amoun t of support that came from E urope. The Syrian Latins by themselves were like men fighting with destiny. They took counsel together in the way men always do when the evil is beyond their control they talked and wrangled and knew in ; their hearts that there was no real remedy. A council was held in Jerusalem in February 1183 to discuss the position of affairs. The only practical result is of some interest in itself. An income tax was imposed. The proceeds were to be devoted to the defence of the kingdom and to no other purpose. It was a graduated tax like its modern representatives. It was also236\",\"232 SALAH ED-DIN YUSUF A.D.I183 announced as temporary and exceptional. After this the knights of the kingdom waited until Saladin should return.

On the march a band sent out to reconnoitre encountered the troops of Kerak and Shaubak on their way to join the main army. An engage- ment followed in which many of the Latins were killed or taken prisoners. The news caused great joy in the Moslem army and was hailed as an omen of further victory(30th September)^ On the following day the Latins advanced from Saffuriya. They took up their position at El-fula^ within a mile of Saladin's position, beside another fountain. It seems that the Latin army numbered thirteen hundred knights and fifteen thousand foot soldiers'. The oldest men did not remember the gathering of such a host. A fresh crusade had recently arrived and even the crews ofthe Italian ships which carried it swelled their numbers. It is unlikely that Saladin's army was equally numerous.

Sybil's husband Guy was their nominal leader. William of Tyre does not positively assert that it was jealousy of his advancement and dissension among the chiefs that prevented the Latins from taking the offensive, but plainly he inclines to this view. The strength of Saladin's position was given as a reason for not moving and the probability of his having a greater number of troops with him than appeared. The Latins entrenched them- selves on the hill-slopes^ and refused to be drawn from their defences.

Saladin wasnotdiscouraged by the issueofhis invasion. The weakness ofthe Latins was as manifest as their strength. When the Moslems retreated they did so only to change the point and manner of their attack.

After a few days' attack Saladin resolved to fill up this chasm so as to be able to deliver a direct assault upon the walls(Thursday i6th August)^ This was accomplished and at the same time the siege engines bombarded the castle with terrifying effect. There was hope in the Moslem camp that success would soon crown these efforts. But when news was brought that a Latin army was advancing from Jerusalem Saladin judged it prudent to meet them on the way. He found them posted at El-wala, a spotvery difficultofaccess,and accord- inglytook up his position justoppositethem at Heshban.

About this time Saladin received news that his possessions in Mesopotamia were again in danger. He decided to make peace with Jerusalem that he might be free to deal with the situation in the north. When Raymond on behalf of the Latin king made overtures to him peace was arranged for a period of four years'* from the following Easter (ist April 1185). Of course the intervening months until Easter were also included in the duration of the truce'. Saladin left Damascus some time in February* and he was absent in the north for fifteen months. Although it suited Saladin's plans to have peace with his opponents, the first overtures seem to have been made by the Latins. Theexperienceofthe years 11 83-84had shown howfatal the dissensions within the kingdom might prove to be at any moment if the war with Saladin were continued. The causes of thediscord have been already stated. Baldwin struggled bravely to discharge his duties and accompany his troops in the field. But in spite of this every campaign raised afresh the question who should take the king's place. Guy's marriage with Sybil had given him a strong claim.

The confused narrative of Benedict i. 345 and 359 is inconsistent with hisrepresentationand yet supplies a certain amount of conRnnation of it. Benedict makes the truce consist of two terms, the second an extension of the first. The first was to last until\\\"next Easter,\\\" i.e. Easter of 1186 (seeingtheyearinquestionis 1185);thesecondforthreeyearslonger. Thisagreeswith Emoul in making the truce commencein 1185 and last in all for nearly four years. ItishoweverimpossiblethatGuyshould haverenewed the truce, forhewas notking in April 1186, and the date of the arrangement of the truce is given in the wrong year 1185 (6-9months too late).

But in the camp at Saffuriya in September 1183 Baldwin com- mitted the direction of affairs to Guy. In fact he almost abdicated in Guy's favour and this mortified Raymond and estranged his friends. But Guy was not strong enough to assert his position and this seems to have been the principal cause of the inaction which the Latins displayed on that occasion. As Baldwin had notlongto livethefurtherquestion ofthe succession to the throne was involved in the arrangements that were made. As early as November 1183 Baldwin saw the impossibility of a settlement on the lines of his first attempt. After a dispute he had v/ith Guy he was still more inclined to listen to other proposals. Towards the end of November he announced his intention of resuming his former power. At the same time he permitted his nephew, a child scarcely five years old, to be crowned his heir (20th of November)^ This change, by itself, was not sufficient. It was nogreat advantage tohave aboy king A co-regent with a dying prince. few days later, accordingly,on the way to Kerak, Baldwin made a further concession to Ray- mond's party. Thecount was recognised asleaderoftheexpedi- tion. The estrangement between the king and Guy was now accentuated. Baldwin desiredif possible to annul his marriage, but this could not be accomplished. At a council held in 'Akka the patriarch, the Master of the Temple and the Master of the knights of St John all spoke in Guy's favour and when they were notlistened to they left the assembly. After this Raymond was declared regent with the approval of most of those present. On certain conditions his regencywas to last ten years^ It was he whorelieved Kerak in thesummerof1184and in thefollowing winter made peace with Saladin for four years. For a time all went well.

According to the agreement Raymond was to remain regent until a new king had been chosen bythe Pope, the emperor of Germany and the kings of France and England. But this did not please those who were opposed to Raymond, amongst others the Templars and Reginald of Kerak. They cleverly seized Jerusalem and claimed the throne for Guy on the ground that his wife was the nearest heir. <Raymond and his friends were then at Nablus. Reginald having joined Guy in Jerusalem the patriarch announced that he was willing to crown him king. After the ceremony was performed Guy took pos- session of the royal treasure. The boldness of the proceedings andtherefusalofHumphrey,husbandofSybil'sonlysisterIsabel, to make a stand against Guy, his practical acceptance, indeed, of the situation, worked strongly on the minds of Raymond's supporters. One after another theydropped away from him and acknowledged the new king. Raymond betook himself to his fief in Tiberias in the bitterest anger. Guy was preparing to attack him there when he learned that his rival had asked and had been promised the assistance of Saladin. The sultan was at Banyas watching the course of events and Guy's principal supporters, the Templars, were unpopular. For these reasons no attack was made on Raymond and perhaps his Moslem allies did not actually draw their swords on his behalf against his fellow-Christians''. The knowledge that Saladin's forces would join in the fray prevented a conflict At the same time it greatly intensified the animosity with which Raymond was regarded by his opponents and for a time the situation was most critical. (p. 736, n. 3). 'Imad ed-din in A.S. Goergens 59 (undera.h. 581) says he reigned about ten years; since Amalric died in A.H. 569 this is an underestimate.

His purpose was to settle, once for all, his relations with Mosul. 'Izz ed-din and others were still disposed to cause him trouble in Mesopotamia. After a brief pause in Aleppo Saladin's campaign commenced about the beginning of ApriP. Active and successful operations occupied all the summer; but still Mosul itselfremained unconquered. Whilst it was being attacked for the third time Saladin became seriously ill (October)l His death was actually reported in Aleppo. But by the end of February he was convalescent and envoys came from Mosul to make an agreement with him regarding the boundaries of his sultanate and that of 'Izz ed-din. On the 3rd of March (i186)=^ the terms ofa permanent treatywere definitely agreed to. On the 6th of April Saladin returned to<^^^££^, completely restored to health, and on the 23rd of May he entered Damascus again^ The great popular rejoicings in both cities were evidence of the attachment of his subjects to their sovereign. Ko-doubt Saladin's illness and recovery impressed him^with a deeper sense than ever ofhis obligation to pursug the JLatin-wan it may then perhaps b^ put to his credit that he remained faithful to the terms of his treaty with the Latins of Jerusalem when their situation offered so favourable an oppor- tunity for him to attack them. But no doubt he prepared for eventualities, especially after Raymond appealed to him for support. Probably the return of El-*adil to Egypt was directly connected with the plans he was now devising.

Yet powerful influences were at work against it in the ranks of the ruling party. The peace had been concluded by Raymond, who was now an enemy of the king. In the quarrel between Raymond and Guy the Moslems had taken a side and that against the established government. Thus the peace assumed the character of something personal to Raymond, and Guy stood already in an attitude hostile to the sultan. It is easy to understand the growing feeling of a party that war with the Moslems was natural and inevitable and that the peace was the act of a suspect and almost a traitor. Under these circumstances it was scarcely to be expected that the Latins would wait for the expiry of the four years' truce before resuming hostilities'.

His castles commanded the roads to Egypt and to_Mekka and fr om them he had been accustomed to plunder the passing caravans. He was on good terms with the Arabs of the district^ who acknowledged no allegiance to Saladin and paid little respect to the faith of Islam.

The knights heard of this at El-fula in the plain of Ibn 'Ammar where they spent Thursday night-'. They hastily summoned all the soldiers they could gather in the neighbour- hood, and having collected a force of about one hundred to one hundred and forty knights and from three to four hundred foot- soldiers* theyattacked the enemynear Saffuriya'. The Moslems, being probably much superior in numbers, gained a victory in which many of the knights were slain and most of the survivors were taken prisoners. The incident encouraged the one side as much as it alarmed the other.

II87 purpose of the Latins was to cut their way through to Tiberias and in this they failed. As they advanced they were completely enveloped by the Moslem army^ In spite of every effort their advance gradually came to a stand. The decisive factors no doubt were the excessive heat of a July day and the almost entire lack of water. Evening fell without a definite result having been reached but the issue was no longer doubtful. Both parties camped as they had fought',the Latins being so hemmed in that a cat could not have escaped through the Moslem lines*. The Latin soldiers were tired and dispirited, Saladin's troops were exultant and confident of victory. On the one side the hours of darkness passed wearily, on the other the triumphant repetition of the great watchword of Islam seldom died away \\\" God is great, God is great, there is no god but God\\\" sounded again and again through the stillness of the night. \\\" Malik was watching and Ridwan rejoiced*.\\\" Next morning the battle was not long continued. Saladin pressed the attack with vigorous decision. The Latins were already beaten and exhausted men. Their foot and horse, which should have protected one another, parted company^ The infantry retreated up the hill side almost overpowered by thirst. The horsemen were completely exposed to the arrows of the enemy, who closed round both divisions of the army. At this point* Raymond and his soldiers cut their way through and escaped.

Saladin deliberately persisted in his policy long after it was clear what the result must be. That in itselfforbids any rash condemnation of it. Besides we mayeasilyexaggerate the influence which the failure to capture Tyre exercised on the course ofevents. The determining factor in the contest was the intervention of the west. The issue of the struggle between Saladin and the third crusade was little affected by the fact that Tyre was a Latin stronghold when thecrusaders landed. It was of vital consequence that almost the whole country was in Saladins possession and this resultwas largelydue to the policy which he adopted. January and February 1188 were spent for the most part in 'Akka. The fortifications were strengthened and increased. The two following months were spent in seeking to bring to a conclusion the siege of the Hospitallercastleof Kaukab el-hawa, the star of the air. At the end of 1187 the frontier castles of Jerusalem, as well as Tyre, still resisted the Moslems. During all his movements Saladin kept troops round them. Hunain was captured on the 26th of December^ before the siege ofTyre was raised. Of those remaining Kaukab was specially noxious, for it commanded the direct approach from the Hauran to the plain of Ibn 'Ammar. Its garrison, too, had been emboldened by some success gained over its besiegers. Hence no doubt Saladin's resolve to superintend the siege in person. It was still in progress, however, when spring called him away to prepare for a new campaign. Antioch and Tripolis presented a wider field ofenterprise than the fragments ofthe Latin power in the south.

A fortnight or more was now spent in the neighbourhood of Homs, waiting the first arrivals of the troops which were to take part in the summer campaign. On the 30th of May the sultan pitched his camp east of Hisn el-akrad on the borders of Tripolis. El-'adil remained in Palestine to watch over Moslem interests there. He took up his position at Tibnin so as to hold the Latins ofTyre in checks During the month of June Saladin's headquarters were stationary. His operations were directed against the towns and castles ofTripolis. Probably his forces were not large at any ; rate nothing permanent was accomplished. The country was ravaged and the Latins did not dare to stir from their strong- holds. But not one capture seems to have been made. The little state of Tripolis suffered least of all from the catastrophe ofthe Latin power^. It was in June 1188 that Beha ed-din, Saladin's future bio- grapher, entered his service. Throughout the remainder of the summer he and Tmad ed-din were both in the sultan's camp. About the end of the month Saladin gave orders that Guy should be brought from Damascus previous to his being set at liberty. His release took place at Antartus in the first week of July^ It is said that Saladin unwarrantably imposed upon him the fresh condition^ that he should leave the country and not again take up arms against his captor. The promise was actually made although Guy, whatever his excuse, did not observe it. Queen Sybil had been in Tripolis for some time and there her husband joined her.

The summer campaign really commenced when the camp at Hisn el-akrad broke up on the ist of July. The wonderful record of the previous year now finds a parallel in Saladin's achievements against the towns and castles of Antioch. The immediate surrender oftowns like Jabala and Laodicea may be accounted for by the impression which had been produced by the events of last summer and by the presence of disaft'ected elements in the population, Moslem and native Christian. After the surrender of Laodicea no large town was attacked. There were actually none in Antioch except the capital itself. But two monthswerespent in an unbroken seriesofoperationsagainst its strong castles and towers. Saladin's ability in the conduct of siegeoperations and theskill ofhisengineers must notbeignored. But some surrenders at least were made from mere fainthearted- ness when the prospects of the Moslems were by no means bright. The longest siege lasted less than a fortnight. In addition to Antartus, Jabala and Laodicea, some ten fortresses or castles were taken from the Latins. The last was Bagras, which surrendered on the 26th of September^ ^ The chronicle is as follows: the camp broke up on July ist.

Its occupation by Saladin now opened communication across the hills to Hama. Laodicea surrendered without asiege, the town on Thursday July 21st (A.S. iv. 359 quoting Beh. has the textual error 14th Jumada i for 74th Jumada i), the two or three castles which were its protection on the following Saturday.

It is difficult to reconcile such a statement with those of I.A. and 'Imad ed-din. It appears to imply that the castle was invested and captured whilst Saladin was263\",\"A.D. 1188 SALAH ED-DIN YUSUF 259 All this time Bohemond of Antioch did not make a single movement. His inaction hastened the surrenderofsomecastles, at least, which would have prolonged their resistance if he had given them any expectation ofrelief. Attheend of September it seemed likely that Antiochitselfwould be besieged. Bohemond then sent envoys asking for a truce. Saladin agreed on the condition that all Moslem prisoners should be released. He knew how strong Antioch was and his army was again tired and anxious to disperse. It was arranged that the truce should last until the end of the following May. It is said to have been agreed that Antioch should then surrender unless help had previously arrived from Europe. The condition could not be of much importance in the eyes of anyone\\\\ Bohemond would certainly not surrenderwithout resistanceand ofcourse crusaders from the west were sure to come, and actually did so. But Saladin's own energywas notexhausted. Heproceeded, indeed, leisurely southwards, for it was some time since he had been in the northerntowns,and it was the ist ofRamadan (24th October) before he reached Damascus. But although the fast month had thus commenced he recognised that there was im- portantwork forhim to doin Palestine. Therewere Latincastles still unconquered whichwere pointsofdisturbance and centres of danger. Safed and Kaukab in particular were like thorns inthe flesh ofMoslem territory.

When Frederick of Germany was in Cilicia (in June 1190) the Moslems deserted Bagras (\\\"Gaston\\\") and it was occupied by a relative of Leo's who held it for 20 years in spite of the claims of the Templars that it should be restored to them (Eracles ii. 136f.).

The year 1189 was not far advanced before it became clear that Saladin in turn must stand on the defensive. He spent the early months in a tour ofinspection of the towns he had gained in 1187. Jerusalem, Ascalon and *Akka were visited in turn. It was not simply that the administration of these towns and districts required attention their fortifications needed to be seen ; to. There were signs already of the coming storm and prepara- tions had to be made. The Latins of Tyre under Conrad and those of Tripolis under Guy were growing bolder. Already they had begun to take the offensive. All through the past year crusading bands had been arriving from Europe in Italian ships. News came, besides, that for the third time in crusading history Europe had been roused to a mighty effort. During the years before Hattin embassies from Jerusalem and the appeals of the Pope had prepared the way for a general crusade. The fall ofJerusalem acted as a spark to a train which had been laid and all Christendom was aflame again. The quarrels of France and England delayed the crusade for a time but finally it was jointly organised by Philip of France and Richard of England. Frederick of Germany completed his preparations and started first More truly than ever before Christendom and Islam armed to do battle with one another, each for the faith that was in them. In the very beginning of 1189 it still seemed possible to Saladin that he could undertake, when the season came, a further campaign against Antioch and Tripolis^ Before the moD0i ending 19th May 1189 (Beh. iii. 11a),apparentlyabout the 5th of May, 17th Rabi*i 585, alittleearlierorlater. * Saladin left Damascus on November 7th.

In July, particularly, several skirmishes of minor consequence took place and in one of these Saladin lost 180 men. While thus lying in the Marj 'uyun Saladin was in a position to press toward the surrender of Shakif Arnun, Arnold's castle on the banks of the Leontes^. Its owner had been known as Reginald ofSidon. He agreed in the month of May to surrender the castle by the 13th ofAugusts But when the time came he would nothold to hisagreement, ifheever intended todoso.

King Philip landed in April 1191 and Richard ofEngland in the followingJune. Only the outstanding features and a sketch of the general progress of the siege are contained in the following pages. Guy's forces when he reached 'Akka were not such as to enable him to invest the city. He simply pitched his camp against it on the northern side. When Saladin arrived two days later he found no difficulty in reinforcing and provisioning the town. Even afterthe Latinshad been strengthened bynumerous crusading bands and had completely invested the city(Thursday 14th September)* Saladin two days later broke the cordon and maintained communication by land with the defenders of the town. But still an unending stream of fresh arrivals swelled the Latin army. Saladin's one determined efforttodrivethem away was made some time after he had restored communication with 'Akka. It was unsuccessful. On the4th ofOctober the Latins, in their turn,being reinforced by Conrad'stroopsand others, madea determined attack on Saladin. Saladin's centre and left drove back those opposed to them and the Master of the Temple was killed. But the rout of the Moslem right wing and their panic- stricken flight to the Jordan and even beyond it must have shaken the confidence of Saladin's troops. Other causes, how- ever, are chiefly accountable for the sultan's failure to hold his forces to their task, so that the Latins without further difficulty cut off\\\" all access to the town on the landward side. Ramadan commenced on the 13th of October. That was an excuse if not a reason for suspending operations. The northern emirs and their levies were also anxious to return home. When Ramadan was over winter would be upon them. To crown all Saladin was disabled by fever^ He urged that the offensive ought boldly to be taken, but he could not resist the voice of the emirs correct it corresponds to 23rd August, since the day was Wednesday (Kem.).

Saladin bitterly contrasted the devotion of the \\\"infidels\\\" with the lukewarmness of the \\\"true believers\\\" and sent letters and envoys in every direction to stir men to the holywar. Through the winter he remained on guard with a fresh body of troops from Egypt^ His only actual achievement was the provisioning of the town, to which there was still access by sea. On the other side the Latins suffered greatly from scarcity offood and the inclemencyof the weather. Operations on both sides commenced again about the end of April (1190)*. As soon as Saladin's first reinforcements arrived he resumed his old position at Tell kisan (25th April)^ Two days later (27th April)^ the closer character of the Latin attack was signalised by the advance against the walls of three great siege towers which had been constructed during the winter. They towered high above the ramparts of the city and the citizens were in despair at their failure to effect anything against them. Saladin drew closer to the Latins (2nd May)^ and con- stantlyharassed them in thehopeofcausingadiversion.

The Latins seem to have left Saladin himself undisturbed. As the summer passed the German section of the third crusade was expected and was on its way. Saladin sent back the northern levies to watchthe frontiers bywhich the route ofthe expedition lay. The walls of Sidon and Jubail were destroyed and the inhabitants were removed to Beirut^ Frederick came overland through Greece and Asia Minor. The policy of the emperor Isaac Angelus was not more favourable to the crusaders than that of his predecessors had been. In fact he was an ally of Saladin's and kept him informed of what was going on in western Europe. Nevertheless Frederick crossed safely into Asia Minor. Therehe was more fortunatethan the first crusaders had been. Kilij Arslan of Rum being Saladin's inveterate enemy was inclined to treat with Frederick and offered very little opposition to the progress of the crusade. But in Cilicia, just when the goal was at hand, misfortune overtook the German expedition.

Itmaybeinferred thatthe 100 prisoners of distinction were included in the first batch tobereleased but thisisnot definitelystated, nor is the division of the remainingobligationsbetweenthesecond and third terms. It maybe assumed thatthisthreetermarrangementwasamodifi- cationoftheoriginal agreement madebytheemirs. ItwasSaladin'sproposal (Beh.) andthereforenotpart of thefirstagreement. *Imaded-din, whodoesnot, however, mention anyalteration in the terms, explicitlystates that the emirs had agreed that half the money,all the prisoners and the holycross should behandedover \\\"atthe endof themonth\\\"and that theotherhalf of themoneyshouldbe paidattheendof the following month (Landberg 358f.). This agreeswith I.A.'s statementthattwo months were allowed for the discharge of the Moslem obligations (Kamil ii. 46).

Alternatively, if they released their prisoners at once, Saladin offered to give hostages that he would complete the discharge of his obligations on the dates that had been fixed 1 i8th Rajab (Beh. iii. 241). ThisisconfirmedbyIt. Ric 232, whosaysthatthe conditionswere to be fulfilled in amonth. Buthesupposedthatthismonthwasthe monthofJuly (It. Ric. 236 and 241).

Hemaythereforehavedatedtheexpiryofthetermatthe end ofJuly. 2 Beh. iii. 242 and 'Imad ed-din 371. It appears likely that on the nth of August the prisoners of distinction chosen bythe Latinsfor releasehadnotallbeen brought to theMoslem camp near 'Akka (Beh.). Butthefactisnotdecisiveonthe point of Saladin'sabilitytofulfilhisobligationswhenitbecamenecessary, especially if thedate of the first term had alreadybeenextendedat Richard'srequestfromthe Qth (or nth) to the 20th of August (Benedict ii. 187). It is equally true that Richard was not in a position to release all the Moslem prisoners on the nth of August. Somewere stillinthecustodyofConradofTyreandit wasevendoubtfulit theEnglishkingcouldgetpossessionofthematall (Benedictii. 187). Thequestion whether Saladin finally, on the 20thof August, was inapositiontofulfilhisobliga- tionsisnoteasytoanswerdefinitelybecauseof theconflict of testimonybetweenthe eastern and western sources. The probabilities of the case depend largely on the extent of the obligations to be discharged onthatday. Saladin'schief difficultyno doubt was thecollectingof theprisonerswhomthe Latinsnamedforrelease. If the 100wereto besetfreealltogetherinthefirstbatch (seep. 270, n. 3)itisconceivable that Saladin did not succeed ingatheringthem completelyoratleastthattheLatins might plausibly allege that he had not done all he was bound to do. Assuming however that he exerted himself to do his part, as he reallydid, it isunlikelythat more than a veryfew of those still alive werewanting and one would suppose that even theywould in the end be traced. 'Imad ed-din 371 definitelyasserts that the prisonerswereallassembledand presumably Saladin negotiated on the basis of this assumption (cf. Beh.). ThestatementofBenedictii. 189thatonthe i6th of August Saladin acknowledged that he could not fulfil his part of the compact certainly demands qualification and may be as unfounded as the following statement that Saladin executed his captives onthe i8th. Theallegationthat Saladinasked foran extension of time on the 15th (Benedict ii. 188) is not indeed incredible, but may simply be the western way of putting Saladin's proposal as reported by Beh. and •Imaded-din. Ambrosespeaksingeneral termsof the Moslemsdemanding \\\"terms and respites thattheymightseektheCross\\\" (lines 5398-99) andrepresentsSaladin's conductasaconsequence of hisbadfaithandunwillingnesstofulfilhisengagements.

It is difficult to understand why. Not only were they reasonable, it would have been absurd for Saladin to commit himself without some such arrangement. The honour of a Christian king was not to be so lightly trusted^ In any case the Moslems did not fulfil the conditions which were agreed to when 'Akka was surrendered. The contingency, however, must have been foreseen and provided for. Neither the emirs nor the Latins could suppose that Saladin was bound to carry out their agreement. Beha ed-din says that the lives of the garrison and of the citizens were guaranteed in considera- tion of the surrender of the town''. If so Richard was guilty of a dastardly act of ill faith when he led out 26CXD prisoners to execution on Tuesday the 20th of August'. Even if their lives appearasif the requests for an extension of timewere madeafter theexpiryof the term fixed andjustbeforetheexecution oftheprisoners. Besidestheevidenceofthe translator is weakened by his misapprehension of the date when the term expired (p. 271, n. i).

No doubt it was currently reported in the Latin camp that thesultaneithercouldnotfulfilhisobligationsorwasunwillingtodoso. ^ Accordingto LA. Kamil ii. 47,RicharddemandedthatSaladinshoulddischarge hisobligations(i.e.thoseofthe firstterm) andtrusttoreceivinginexchangeapartof the Moslem captives selected bythe Latins themselves. Beh. agrees that Richard expected Saladin to surrender the instalment of thefirstterm withoutanyguarantee that the Latins would give anything in return. There can be little doubt that Richard'sanswerwasdueat firsttohis being unable to guarantee the release of the Moslemprisoners (cf.Benedictii. 187, andp. 271, n. 7). Butafterthe 12th ofAugust all the prisoners hadcome intohishands (Benedict) andthisdifficultywasremoved. May it then be supposed that having once given his answer he adhered to itfrom motives of personal feeling rather than of publicpolicy? The first-rateevidenceof the Arabic sources (Beh., *Imad ed-din and LA.) seemstoestablish beyonddispute thatthenegotiationswerebrokenoffbecauseSaladinwasdissatisfiedwith themanner inwhich the Latins proposed toperform theirobligations, and wasinfactsuspicious of theirgoodfaith. Theexplanationof thewesternsources, that Saladin wasunable tofulfiltheterms of thetreatywithinthe timefixed, apartfrom thequestion of fact, whichismorethandoubtful(p. 271, n. 2), isinitselflessplausible. Theextensionof the first term beyond the 9th or the nth of August was in anycase notcaused by Saladin's inability to discharge his obligations (Benedict ii. 187), and it is very improbable that mere unreadiness on Saladin's part would have put an end to the negotiations. The 16th of August is the latest date for which an exchange of messagesisrecorded (Benedict ii. 188f.). In Richard'sown letter.(Hovedeniii. 131) the onlycomment on the breaking off of the negotiations is contained inthewords ••terminoexspiratoet pactionequam pepigerat[SaladinusJ penitusinfirmata.\\\" '^ Beh. iii. 242; cf. p. 273, n. 1.

II9I DISSENSIONS OF THE LATINS 2/3 were not expressly safeguarded^ the circumstances of their surrender gave them a certain claim to be spared. There is not much support for the view that Richard wished to retaliate for the execution of the Templars and the Hospitallers after Hattin. But if this was his motive, he much surpassed the example which he followed. The curse of such vendettas is that they invariably lead tothesheddingofmoreblood. Saladin now systematically executed the crusaders whom he captured. The capture of 'Akka cannot be regarded as agreatachieve- ment. The efforts ofthe crusade and ofthe Syrian Latins were confined to this one enterprise for two whole years. A better policywould havebeentoemploythestrengthandtheenthusiasm whichpoured withoutstintinto Palestinedirectlyagainst Saladin himself The Moslems would surely have been beaten in the open field and then the reconquest of the country would not have been so difficult. After all, the Latins had gained only a single town and were faced by an almost unbeaten enemy. It was not indeed too late to adopt a resolute and well-planned course ofaction. But what hope was there of this being done? Saladin in fact had onlyto stand aloof until the influences in his favour within the enemy's ranks had worked out their disinte- gratingeffects. The combination ofdifferent nationalities in the crusading host was a guarantee that there would be jealousyand hatred, discord and strifeamongst them. The presence ofPhilip and of Richard in the same camp made this assurance doubly sure. They brought with them the memory of old quarrels and rival interests. Their respective claims of superiority were certain to create division. Guy and Conrad were another pair ofrivals.

II9I Conrad married Isabel, Sybil's half-sister, in the end of 1 190 and thus acquired a certain legal title to the throne, for Sybil was now dead. Philip of France supported his claim. Guy turned to Richard to espouse his cause and of course the English king did so. Thus the rivalry between Richard and Philip was interwoven with the quarrel between Guy and Conrad. After the capture of 'Akka an agreement was made by which Guy was to be king during his lifetime,while Conrad and hisdescend- ants were to be his heirs. Meantime Conrad was assigned half the revenues ofthe kingdom and the lordship of certain towns. Philip now prepared to return home he sailed from *Akka on ; the last day of July (1191). His excuse was the state of his health. Perhaps he found the situation in Palestine intolerable. Probably the interests ofFrance required his return home. The English bluntly accuse him of treachery during Richard's absence. Philip's departure did not improve the situation in Palestine. Most of the French crusaders remained under the leadership of the Duke of Burgundy. Richard was practically commander-in-chief but his authority was seriously limited. Those who sided with Conrad would take no part in his enterprises. Conrad himself remained in Tyre watching his opportunity to make fresh gains. Very soon he began to negotiate with Saladin on his own account. The future ofthe crusade now depended very much on how Richard filled his position. Thesituation was extremelydifficult butthetruth is thatthe English kingwas peculiarly unfit to make the best of it. Possibly it never entered his mind that his first duty was to reconcile the conflicting elements and interests in his army. He made himselfthe champion ofa party,which was inexcusable seeing he had not the power to secure its triumph. Nor had he any qualities of generalship to compensate for his lack of policy. He seems to have regarded war merely as a gloriousfightwith theenemieswhocrossed his path. Hedoes not appear to have seen the importance of forcing a decisive battle with Saladin. He allowed himself to be swayed by the con- sideration that the main object of the crusade was the recovery of Jerusalem and yet he did not devote himself strenuously to accomplish even this. He seems to have vacillated between the279\",\"A.D.I191 ADVANCE TO JAFFA 2/5 views of others and the demands of his personal circumstances. Itwas not lack ofenthusiasm amongthe crusadersthat prevented hisundertakingthesiegeofJerusalembuthisowndilatoryactions. Richard's desire to return to England was the final ruin of the enterprise. Ascalon, it seems, was selected as the first point of attack after the fall of *Akka. Its usefulness as a base of operations against Jerusalem commended the choice. But a terrible experience awaited the crusading host on the road. From *Akka to Jaffa is a distance of eighty miles. The soldiers of the first crusade covered the ground in some ten days, inclusive ofhalts. Richard's soldiers entered Jaffaon theseventeenthday after starting. Several days were spent in waiting for the ships which were to convoy them down the coasts But afterwards it was probably the exhaustion of the soldiers that necessitated frequent rests. The heat was almost unbearable and the means of transport were insufficient. Men had to carry what baggage animals usually convey and the ships were only a small measure of relief. Even food wasscarce. Lightly-armed Moslem troops hungon theflanks,cuttingoffstragglers and increasingthe strain by occasional dashes on the line of march. Twice at least the Latins had to fight a serious engagement with Saladin's troops. In each case they were further crippled by a serious loss of horses. It was the 25th of August when they left their con- centration camp on the outskirts of 'Akka^ When they reached Jaffa on the loth of September the chiefs of the army were nearly unanimous that they should proceed no further but should fortifyJaffa as abaseofoperations againstJerusalem. Richard objected but was overruled. Jaffa was the grave of the crusade.

It is doubtful if he could have mustered an army 1 capable of doing successful battle with the crusaders even had his emirs been less dispirited than they were. Some time previously Haifa, Caesarea, Arsuf and Jaffa had been dis- mantled'. This deprived the Latins of depots and resting places on the road to Jerusalem. The attack on their rearguard on the day they started, before they had reached Haifa, was made by a portion only of Saladin's troops and he was not himself present during the engagement. Saladin moved south- wards in front of the Latins and twice, where the ground was favourable, attacked them more boldly than usual, as they left Caesarea on the ist of September\\\" and as they entered Arsuf on the 7th.

It was understood to be the objective of the Latin march, its occupation by the enemy would supply them with an excellent base of operations against Jerusalem and would break the direct line of communi- cation with Egypt. Saladin would have preferred to defend Ascalon against attack^ but the temper of his emirs compelled him to recognise that this was impossible. From the 12th to the 23rd of September he was engaged in superintending the work of destruction. Then he dismantled Ramla and Lud and retired to En-natrun (4th October)^. He was resolved to con- centrate all his strength on the defence of Jerusalem. The conflicts with the crusaders at this time were mere skirmishes between scouting and foraging parties. Meantime the Latins completed the fortification ofJaffa and ofsome castles in the neighbourhood. Richard found it difficult to get the soldiers of other nationalities to support him even in this. He actually journeyed to *Akka to urge the crusaders there to join him. His principal concern at this time, however, was the conduct of certain negotiations with the Moslems. It may have prevented more active military operations. El-'adil was the negotiator on the Moslem side. He seems to have had his first interview with the English king, at Richard's request, on the way from 'Akka to Jaffa (5th September)''. As soon as it was decided that the Latin advanceshould stop at Jaffa Richard renewed his overtures (about September nth or I2th)^ There is no doubt he desired to leave Palestine in the following spring if possible, and probably he hoped that Saladin would come to terms without further fighting. His experience on the way south, his knowledge of the time that had been consumed in the siege of 'Akka and the divisions which diminished the efficiency ofthe crusade,all strongly prompted him to negotiate. 1 Tuesday 17thSha'ban (Beh.).

II9I Richard's view ofsatisfactory terms at first included the restora- tion to the Latins ofall the country that Saladin had conquered. It was only to gain time that El-'adil kept up discussion on the point. The negotiations were partofthe Moslem defence. They postponed the attack on Jerusalem and increased the chance of the crusade breaking up. Richard may not have understood the language of oriental diplomacy. It appears, in any case, that he acquired a genuine liking for El-'adil and found pleasure in cultivating his friendship. Interviews and exchange of messages went on until about the 8th of October. Then a journey of Richard to 'Akka took place' and interrupted the negotiations. When theywererenewed they almost immediately took the form of an interesting proposal from Richard that El- 'adil and a Latin princess, Richard's own sister, should jointly rule the whole kingdom of Jerusalem\\\"^. Both Richard and Saladin were to surrender their conquests to these representa- tives of east and west. Certain villages were to belong to the military orders. The holycross was to be restored to the Latins (20th October). El-'adil treated the offer seriously and was personally favourable to it. Even Saladin expressed approval, but only, according to Beha ed-din, because he did not think Richard was in earnest. In fact Richard ultimately announced that his sister's unwillingness to wed a Moslem was fatal to the project. Still he added that if El-'adil would become a Christian he thoughttheproposal might becarried through(23rd October). It maybe assumed thattheschemecommended itselfto Richard as a good solution ofhisdifficulties,but no doubt it was opposed by others than his sister and so became impracticable. For a short time the negotiations came to a standstill. Richard was not alone in making overtures to Saladin. As early as the 4th ofOctober an envoy came from Conrad offering to break with Richard if Beirut and Sidon were given him in * This visit may be identified with that alx)ve referred to which is related by Ambrose409= It. Ric. a86. Beh. iii. 371 reportsthatit wassupposed in the Moslem camp that Richard had gone to have an interview with Conrad because he w.as treating with Saladin. That may be regarded as an error.

In the be- ginning of November communications with Conrad again come to lightl It appears that El-*adil was opposed to makingterms 'vith him and urged that a treaty should be made with Richard. Richard soon ascertained that Conrad was negotiating with the Moslems and doubtless this increased his desire to come to an understanumg. On the 8th of November^ he renewed his overtures and Saiadin found himself in the agreeable position of being solicited fron two quarters at the same time. He was personally inclined to accept Conrad's proposals. But El-'adil's influence seems to have turned the balance in favour of Richard. Conrad's advances were not encouraged and the discussion of terms with his representatives appears to have gone no further''. Richard now made yet another concession. He was willing that the land should be divided between the Moslems and the Latins. Alternative modes of settlement were proposed either : that the coast-towns should be wholly Latin and the interior Moslem,or that some equal division ofthe wholecountryshould be arranged^ The former alternative offered the more likely basis for a permanent settlement. There is no good evidence to show that the latter was seriously discussed. But the exact point of disagreement between the negotiators is not stated. Probably Saladin insisted now, as indeed afterwards, that Ascalon should not remain in the hands of the Latins. No doubt the privileges to be conceded to the Latins in the holy city also presented difficulties. The issue of the negotiations and therock on which they splitcannotbe definitelyascertained ^ Beh. iii. 270f. ^ Beh.iii. 283, 287; iii. 271 suggests that the negotiationswith Richard had in theintervalputastoptothecommunicationswithConrad. 3 18th Shawal 587 (Beh. iii. 286). * Beh. iii. 290.

He was inclined to continue the contest with the crusaders until they were forced to leave the country. It would not as yet have suited his personal views had the negotiations been successful. They were largely a concession to the feeling oftheemirs^ It wasjust after this that the Latins occupied R?nila (22nd No.vember)^ Their action has the appearance of being a consequence ofthe breakdown of the negotiations with Saladin. It was the firststageofan advanceon Jeri'salem. The Templars and the Syrian Latins were opposed to an immediate attack on Jerusalem but many of the crusaders hailed the movement with enthusiasm. Richard seems to have temporised. The next advance, on December 22nd, to a line along the foot of the hills a few miles further on' can only be regarded as a concession to the enthusiasts. By this time it was impossible to accomplish anything, because so many were opposed to the undertakingand because the rainy season had already set in. On the 8th of January* the crusaders fell back on their old lines at Ramla. There was the greatest murmuring and sorrow amongst those whose hearts were set on the reconquest of Jerusalem. The French in great anger left the army and returned to Jaffa and to *Akka». thispointareference (iii. apof.) to the marriage proposal.

II92 FORTIFICATION OF ASCALON 28l Richard and the Syrian Latins now thought that his original planoffortifyingAscalon might becarried out. Theundertaking was left very much to them. The French gave some help con- ditionally. Conrad still refused to have anything to do with the English king. Richard reached Ascalon on the 20th ofJanuary. Before very long news reached him that the partisans of Guy and Conrad had been fighting in the streets of 'Akka. Conrad actually began to besiege thetown. Richard hastened to'Akka, where he spent more than a month endeavouring to pacify the — combatants (20th February 31st March). Tranquillity was restored in the town, but an interview which Conrad had with Richard came to nothing. Once more negotiations with El-'adil come to light. They were still on the lines laid down in November. The point ofdiscussion that emerges is the control of Jerusalem^ The interesting notice^ that Richard knighted one of El-'adil's sons on Palm Sunday, the 29th of March, may be connected withthese negotiations. It is evidenceof Richard's friendly disposition towards El-'adil. On the 31st of March Richard returned to Ascalon and there continued the work of fortification as best he could himself Just after Easter (5th April) disquieting news came from England which decided him to leave Palestine. When he intimated this to the Syrian barons he found that they objected to being left with Guy as their king and that Conrad was the ruler they preferred. Richard wisely yielded the point and Conrad and he were reconciled. Only a few days later the newly-elected king was assassinated^ (28th April 1192)^ and then Henry of Troyes became the choice of the barons. Richard accepted this nomination also and as compensation to Guy gave him Cyprus, which the English had conquered ^ Beh. iii. 293f. It is no doubt wrong to understand the communications reported by Beh. as if they fully expressed the terms which their senders would regard as satisfactory. They refer only to the points under discussion at the time. 2 It. Ric. 325. ^ Thereisnoreasontosuspect either Richard or Saladin of complicity.

Throughout the month of May Richard was occupied with unimportant movements in the vicinity ofAscalon. Probably he hoped that before he left for England the Syrian Latins would agree to a settlement with Saladin. About the beginning of June, however, the chiefs of the army informed him that they would besiege Jerusalem, whether he accompanied them or not. Richard was perplexed. He wished to return home but he could not endure that the siege of Jerusalem should be undertaken without his sharing in it. Finallyhe promised (4th June) to remain until the following springand tolead thecrusadersagainstJerusalem. Theadvance began at once. The district of En-natrun (9th June) and Bait nuba (nth June) was occupied again as the starting-point of a further advance. But the Latins never moved beyond this point. Insignificant skirmishes and raids occupied them for a time. The presence of the English king was the ruin of the undertaking. Whatever exactly Richard's motives were it is clear that he was unwilling to undertake the siege of Jerusalem and that his unwillingness is directly responsible for the abandonment of the project. The difficulty of the enterprise may have influenced his attitude towards it. He emphasised the want of a sufficient supply of water as a serious obstacle. Saladin had been careful to cut off the supplies usually available in the district. Perhaps this and the other precautions which the Moslems had taken gradually impressed Richard as he lay making preparations, gathering soldiers and obtaining siege machines. Still his conduct before and after this time makes it practically certain that he was personally anxious to get rid of his obligation to besiege Jerusalem. He would not have the dishonour ofturning his back on the crusaders as they advanced and so he strove to induce them to retire. He was willing to approve of anything but the siege of Jerusalem, an attack on Damascus or Beirut or the invasion of Egypt. He was supported by the Italians and by the Syrian Latins, especially by the military orders. They may have been influenced by the motives which Richard professed, but probably they served their own interests also. Accordingly when Richard proposed that the matter should be287\",\"A.D.I192 RETREAT OF THE LATINS 283 left to the decision ofa council of twenty he had no difficulty in nominating it so as to secure the decision he wished. It was agreed to invade Egypt Richard was now at liberty to return ! home. No decision could have been more satisfactory to Saladin. His recent policy had been to await Richard's attack in Jerusalem. With this intention he had strengthened the town and made all his preparations. But his emirs were thoroughly dissatisfied with the plan. They disliked being shut up in the town. They remembered the fate of *Akka. They did not understand that much less resistance than that of the garrison of 'Akka would now suffice to break up the crusade. They proposed that Saladin himself should share in the siege. They wished to risk all on the fortune of a pitched battle. Beha ed- din's description of events just before the crusaders retired has all the detail of a photographic pictured In vain Saladin sought to encourage his emirs. On July 2nd they actually sent a formal message giving it as their opinion that a battle was preferable to a siege. Affairs had now come to a crisis. All that night Beha ed-din remained in attendance on the sultan. They spent it together \\\"in the path of God.\\\" Next day was a Friday. During divine service as the sultan knelt at prayer Beha ed-din noted how his tears rolled down on the carpet. He knew that he was casting his burden on the Lord and he prayed Him to pity and to answer him. That very night the answer came. The scouts brought word of unwonted movements in the enemy's camp. Next day spies told them of the discussion between Richard and the French, and on the same day, July 4th, the Latins commenced to break up their camp^ At once negotiations were resumed. Envoys came from Richard and from Count Henry also. The interchange of messages continued until the 20th^ The general principle that the coast should belong to the Latins and the interior to 1 Beh. iii. 311fiF. - Beh. iii. 315 (21st Jumada i). It.

It was agreed that Jerusalem should be a Moslem city but that Christians should enjoy the right of pilgrimage to it and should hold possession of the Church of the Resurrection. It was over Saladin's demand that Ascalon should be dismantled and belong to neither party that the negotiations split. It seemed too hard to Richard that his labours should be thus undone. Besides the Italians and the Syrian Latins were no doubt also strongly against the proposal. Saladin was now in a position to take the offensive once again. He left Jerusalem on the 23rd of July. His troops skirmished round Jaffa on the 27th, and his camp was pitched before the town on the 28th^ Early in the morning of Friday the 31st' after two days vigorous attack a breach was made in the wall. In a short time the garrison retreated to the citadel, hostilities were suspended and negotiationsregardingcapitulation began. Earlyhowever on Saturday morning, whilstthe arrange- ments for a surrender were being completed, Richard arrived by sea from *Akka. He had heard ofthe attack and at once setout to the rescue. The Moslems posted on the beach were unable to prevent his landing. The garrison sallied from the citadel and the enemy within the walls of the town were driven head- long out. Saladin hastily broke up his camp and retired to a safedistance. Richard pitched his tentsoutside thewalls toavoid infection from the dead bodies within^ The Latins numbered fifty-five knights and 2000 foot-soldiers*.

The numbers engaged on each side were trifling and so were the results involved. From beginning to end everything turned on the valour of a single knight, Richard the lion-hearted. The day opened with an unsuccessful attempt to surprise Richard in his tent in the early morning. When the plan miscarried Saladin ordered a general attack. The English king marshalled his troops in front ofthe city. A line ofmen armed with lances and shields were a wall of defence against attack, and at close intervals amongst them were the balistae, each worked by two men. The first attack ofthe enemywas resolute, but in the end it was beaten back. Then Richard took the offensive at the head of ten knights who alone had horses^ he ; actually charged out on the enemy and cut through their ranks. In recognition of the king's bravery El-*adil is said to have sent him two Arab steeds for use in the battle. After this, in spite of Richard's valour,the Moslems for a time succeeded in closing in. The Italian sailors fled to the galleys on the shore and a party oftheenemy penetrated intothetown. The king,leavingtherest ofthearmyto hold its own,accompanied by his archers and two knights^ cleared the city, brought back the sailors from the ships and resumed his post in the fighting line. His return put fresh spirit into his men. When he charged again into the Moslem ranks the enemy drew back and ventured only to shoot their arrows at him. His armour and that of his horse are described as covered with arrows like the spines of a hedge- hog^ The Moslems completely failed to break their opponents' line and after a last attack about midday^ they abandoned the field (Wednesday 5th August 1192)^ ^ Ambrose 454 = It.

II92 Three weeks now pass during which both parties reviewed their strength and made preparations for a renewal of the conflict. Richard was still unwilling to concede the possession of Ascalon, which was Saladin's condition of peace. But cir- cumstances proved too strong for him. He fell ill, the French abandoned him and Saladin was preparing to attack Jaffaagain. When the Moslems advanced to Ramla on the 27th of August Richard sent a message to El-*adil requesting him to secure peace by whatever means he could. He was now prepared to yield the pointofAscalon. On Wednesdaythe2nd ofSeptember Richard formally swore to observe the terms of the treaty. On the following day Saladin did thesame^ Ramlaand Lud'were assigned to the Latins asdependencies ofJaffa in return fortheir concession regarding Ascalon. The coast from Tyre to Jaffa thus became their portion of the country. No duties were to be imposed by either of the contracting parties on the merchan- dise of the other. Peace was to last three years, but as the term dated from the following Easter and expired at Easter 1196 its actual duration was almost three years and eight months^ In terms of the arrangement the walls of Ascalon were at once completely destroyed. The town was not to be occupied by either party till the expiry of the truce.

He was occupied in dismissing his troops, taking farewell of their leaders, confirming fiefs and making arrange- ments for his journey to Egypt. He was inclined for a time to join the pilgrimage to Mekka. Butsomeofhis advisers strongly urged that he ought not to leavethecountry exposed to the risk of Latin faithlessness. So he put off his last opportunity of performing this sacred duty. Before starting for Egypt he intended to visit Damascus, from which he had been absent nearly four years. He spent twenty days on a tour through the conquered territory, making the arrangements that were — required (15th October 4th November)^ At Beirut he met Bohemond of Antioch and made peace with him also, as previously agreed upon. There was no doubt much business to transact in Damascus and the season was bad, so finally the sultan postponed his intention of visiting Egypt. In Jerusalem on the 29th of January Beha ed-din received a letter announcing this decision and summoning him to Damascus. Probably the reaction from the continuous strain of several years had now set in. Saladin spent much of his time in hunting and also in \\\"hearing the truth\\\" in the assemblies ofthe learned. His last public act was towelcomethepilgrimagehome on Fridaythe 19thofFebruary^ That evening he had an attack of fever. He was ill for only twelve days before he died.

At every stage in the history of the crusading colonies their very existence depended on the amount ofsupport theyreceived from the west. In the early part of the 13th century the re- inforcements which reached Syria from Europe were meagre in the extreme, in the latter part of the century they dwindled away to almost nothing. The fate of the Latin colonies was thereby sealed. For forty years the Moslem sultans on the borders abstained from pressing their advantage, and for the sake of peace restored a number of the places Saladin had won. With the advent of the Mamluk sultans about the middle of the century the situation was profoundly altered. The move- ments of the Tartars in western Asia stirred the neighbouring Moslems to fresh activity. The Latins were again attacked and their weakness became conspicuously evident to themselves and to everyone. They did not venture to contest a single battle in the open field. One after another their towns and fortresses yielded almost without resistance when they were seriously attacked. The end of the Latin colonies in the year 1291 was like the ruin of a house of cards. Such in broad outline is a summary of the last chapter of the history of the crusaders in the east. The crusading spirit of the west was not extinguished, nor for a time appreciably diminished, by the meagre success and indeed practical failureofthe \\\"third crusade.\\\" The old religious enthusiasm still burned among the people, the popes still called the faithful to the deliverance of the Holy Land, and princes recognised their duty as soldiers of Christ and Holy Church, s. c. 19294\",\"290 DECAY OF CRUSADING ZEAL Twice at least a pope was chosen by the cardinals in order that he might give a fresh impetus to the cause of the Latin states. But many influences combined against it. Other crusading enterprises claimed and partly diverted the enthusiasm of the A soldiers of the Cross. mighty force started for Syria in 1202 and spent itself on the conquest of Constantinople and the Byzantine empire (1202-4). From that time, for sixty years and more, much of the spirit of adventure and much of the zeal for religion on which the crusading movement depended were drawn away to Greece. In Prussia and in Spain also there were infidels to be fought and a duty to be performed which discharged crusading vows. The Teutonic order of knighthood, which was established in Syria in 1198, fulfilled its mission chiefly by serving the church and nation in Germany itself These European crusades, as they may be called, were not the only hindrance to the dispatch of much needed rein- forcements to the east. The resources of the church and of the empire were taxed to the uttermost in a struggle between the Pope and the emperors of Germany. Frederick II might have restored the power which Saladin destroyed had not his whole career been one perpetual struggle with the Pope (1220-50). This struggle reached its height after Frederick's death, just when the need of the Syrian states was greatest, when in fact their fate depended altogether on the amount of help they received from Christian Europe. In the latter part of the century one of the most powerful monarchs of Christendom, during the greater part of his reign, was Charles of Anjou, king of Sicily (1262-85). I\\\" ^'s case the hereditary quarrel between the Normans of Sicily and the Greeks, and schemes for the conquest of Constantinople, prevailed over the needs of the Syrian colonies. He diverted one crusade to an attack on Tunis, and all through his reign his influence was unfavourable to the cause of the Syrian crusades. Undoubtedly, also, as the century passed and nothing was accomplished for the Holy Land, when it was seen that popes and emperors, time and again, subordinated its interests to other causes, when great expeditions were prepared and after all diverted to other enterprises, it became inevitable that the295\",\"2 saladin's successors 291 crusading spirit even of the most pious and the most ignorant should gradually fade away. It could not be concealed that the Syrian Latins themselves were unworthy of support. They quarrelled and fought when the enemy were at their gates. They were unfaithful to the common cause for the sake of their private possessions. They were blind to the folly of the course they pursued. At length their appeals roused no more sympathy, and in the end Europe learned of their fate almost with indifference. Saladin's contest with the Latins suggested to him the idea of a counter invasion of Europe by the Moslems. Beha ed-din reports a conversation with the sultan in which he said that if by God's help the Latins were expelled from Syria in his lifetime he would then cross the sea in order to conquer them in their own lands. Such a spirit of devotion to the holy war was not inherited by Saladin's immediate successors. His brother El-*adil (i198-1218) and El-'adil's son and successor El-kamil (1218-38) were greatly influenced by other motives. Wars with Moslem rivals engaged their attention to some extent. But both deliberately pursued a policy of peace with the Latins. They do not appear to have cherished much animosity to Christians as such. They recognised the benefits of commercial intercourse with the west, and perhaps regarded the Latin towns chiefly as important commercial centres. For the sake of Egypt they were willing to leave the Latins in undisturbed possession of the Syrian coast-towns, and to make concessions regarding the occupation ofthe holy places of Palestine. This attitude of theirs finds its parallel in the policy of Frederick II, with whom consequently El-kamil was always on friendly terms. The comparatively short reign of Ayub (1240-49) was much occupied with Moslem wars. But the Kharismian Turks, in alliance with the sultan, swept the Latins once more out of Jerusalem and opened their eyes to what the future might have in store. The concessions of A previous sultans were never afterwards renewed. son of Ayub's was the last of Saladin's family to be sultan of Egypt. The mamluk or slave guard of the sultans supplanted their master and chose one of their number to take his place (1250). — 19296\",\"292 CRUSADES OF THE I3TH CENTURY At first the new dynasty was involved in Moslem wars and menaced by the Tartar invasion ofSyria. Rukn ed-din Baibars (1260-77) was the first after Saladin to wage serious war with the Latins, and the roll of his triumphs bears comparison with that of his great predecessor. Jaffa, Arsuf and Caesarea in the south, Hisn el-akrad, Safitha and other castles in Tripolis, Antioch and most of its dependencies in the north are all in- cluded in the list of his conquests. The sultanate of Kalawun (1279-90) was the next of considerable duration after that of Baibars. Kalawun was at first disposed to maintain peace with the Latin towns. But in the end Tripolis and the sur- rounding district were conquered by him and he was making ready for the siege of *Akka when he died. His unfulfilled intentions in this respect were carried out by his successor without delay. The capture of 'Akka in the following year (1291) was the death stroke of the Latin colonies. Within a few weeks all the towns that still remained surrendered without resistance. The recovery made by the Latin towns in the early part of the 13th century conveys a wrong impression of prosperity and strength until its causes are examined into. Undoubtedly a large proportion of Saladin's conquests were surrendered by his successors. One after another Beirut, Nazareth, Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Safed, Tiberias and even for a short time Ascalon were restored to the Latins. But not one of these places was captured at the sword's point. Beirut and Ascalon were deserted or in ruins when they were reoccupied, the others were surrendered in terms of treaties made by El-'adil, El-kamil and the sultans Isma'il and Ayub(ii98, 1204, '229, 1240-41). The fact is significant. Even thewestern crusadersofthe period won no great victories and made no permanent acquisitions by force ofarms. Thecrusadesof 1217-21 and 1249-50were numerically the most important. Both attempted the conquest of Egypt, and both in the end accomplished absolutely nothing. The minor crusades were more successful ; that is to say, they escaped disaster and brought about or led up to the treaties above mentioned. But this was their good fortune rather than their achievement. The crusade of Frederick II (1228-29) is I297\",\"POSITION OF THE SYRIAN LATINS 293 the best example of its class. Frederick secured concessions by negotiation and because of his reputation, not because of any victory that he won or could have won with the forces at his disposal. These minor crusades at the beginning of the 13th century represented to the sultans the armed force of Europe, which might at any time be hurled against them. No doubt one motive influencing them to make concessions was the desire to avoid the risk of a European invasion on a large scale. The inherent weakness of the Latin towns and the possibility of a great European crusade justify to a large extent the policy of Saladin's successors. The Syrian Latins by themselves were almost powerless. Practically their only hostile movements were made when they were reinforced by the arrival of European crusades. For the most part they gladly agreed to live at peace with their Moslem neighbours. In truth they held their possessions upon sufferance merely. They had not strength to defend themselves successfully against attack. As early as the reign of Ayub, in the middle of the century, this was perfectly evident. The fact that they could not put an army into the field was clear proof of their fatal weakness. Besides, they were distracted by internal feuds and civil war. Contests between rival claimants for the throne, the military orders, and the Italian states, consumed their strength. The remnant of the kingdom of Jerusalem seldom had an effective ruler of its own. The royal title was held nominally by the kings of Cyprus, or the Emperor Frederick, or his son Konradin, or some other descendant of former princes. In reality almost every town and castle acknowledged simply the authority of its own lord. Every district and every city made separate treaties with the Moslems. The military orders defended the border castles and were the principal stay of the kingdom. But their very existence and rivalries increased the elements of division in an already sorely divided state. Saladin's dominions when he died were divided between three of his sons! El-malik el-afdal Nur ed-din 'Ali became ruler of Damascus and southern Syria, El-malik el-'aziz Tmad ed-din 'Othman of Egypt, and El-malik ez-zahir Giyath ed-298\",\"294 GERMAN CRUSADE A.D. 1197 din Gazi ofAleppo and northern Syria. The division weakened the aggressive power of Islam, and tempted the brothers to engage in civil war. El-malik el-afdal was the least popular, and war soon broke out between him and the sultan of Egypt. Their uncle, El-malik el-'adil Saif ed-din Muhammed, Saladin's brother, gave his support finally to El-'aziz, and acting as his deputy became ruler of Damascus in 1196'. In this position his independence was as great as he chose to make it, and when the Latins attempted to retrieve their situation some- what it was El-'adil who took the lead against them, j^^^ The rivals forthe throneofJerusalem did notlongsurvive the arrangement made regarding them (chap. V, p. 281 f.). Guy of Cyprus diedin 1194and wassucceeded byhis brother Amalric II. HenryofChampagne met his death by an accident in September 1197, and he also was succeeded by Amalric (October 1197). By this time the truce with the Moslems had expired'' and the preparations for a fresh crusade had borne fruit in Europe. Henry VI of Germany, \\\"the mightiest of the emperors,\\\" was the inspiring force of the movement, and the crusaders who reached Jerusalem in the autumn of 1197 were chiefly Germans. In the latter part ofAugust,before the arrival ofmostofthe pil- grims, El-*adil besieged Jaffa, and having captured it destroyed the fortifications and left it in ruins^ After this success he fol- lowed a purelydefensive and rather timorous policy. When the crusaders moved against Beirut in October he ordered the town to be evacuated and the fortifications to be destroyed. His attack on the crusaders astheyapproached Sidon on the evening ofthe 22nd was in no way serious andceased at nightfall. Next day the Latins occupied Beirut without resistance. The emir of the town had agreed, and indeed proposed, that the castle on its outskirts should be defended, but as soon as the Latins came in sight he and his garrison deserted their posts (23rd October). The crusaders remained in thetown fora fortnight,whilst El-'adil further ruined the walls of Sidon and laid waste the country ' Sha'ban f,g'i=]u]y 1196 (I.A. Kamil ii. 146).

Its defenders were so hardly pressed that they even negotiated regarding terms ofsurrender. Finally, however,the approach of considerable Moslem forces, gathered from various quarters, induced the Latins to break up the siege (2nd February)'*. Some of the German crusaders sailed home at once, having received news of the death of the emperor, which had taken place in the preceding September. In March, before the de- parture of the others, a Teutonic order of the knights of the Hospital was established. It was intended to be a German counterpart to the older orders, which were chiefly French and Italian in character. Both sides were now anxious to have peace. The Latins were too weak and the Moslems too divided to continue the war with advantage. It was agreed in June^ that there should be peace until the spring of 1204^ unless before that a crowned king came as a crusader to the Holy Land^ Both sides recognised the status quo.

Thesourceswhichspeakof its capture in 1197 are accordinglyinerror(Annales ii.ii. 434f., Gestes 15, Haithiimi. 497). The fortifications of Sidon remained in ruins, although it may have had a Moslem population. The division of its revenues (I.A. Kamil ii. 96) was also300\",\"296 THE \\\"FOURTH crusade\\\" A.D. 1 198-I203 partitioned between the contracting parties, and altogether the Latins had reason to be satisfied with the terms of the agree- ment. El-'adil's advantage was more personal to himself. The peace gave him an opportunity of becoming in reality Saladin's successor. After the death of El-'aziz (November 1198)' he made himself practically ruler of Syria and of Egypt. In the year 1200 he assumed the title of sultan, and after a brief war with Ez-zahir ofAleppo (1201) obtained acknowledgment ofhis dignity from him also (beginning 1202). When Innocent III (i198-1216) became pope, in the be- ginning of 1198, a fresh impulse was given to the crusading movement throughout Europe. Under his inspiration the enthusiasm of the days of the first crusade revived again. Preparations were made for the transport to Palestine of what promised to be an overwhelming force. But just at the last moment, without any consultation with the Pope, the whole enterprise was diverted to war with Greece and to the conquest of Constantinople (1202-4). The long-standing feud between the Greeks and the Latins and the commercial interests of the republic of Venice led to this result. The crusaders were de- pendent on the Venetians for ships and Dandolo, doge of Venice, spoke the decisive word. Except a Flemish fleet only a comparatively insignificant portion of the crusade reached Syria at all (1203). None of its leaders were of sufficient rank to entitle Amalric to break his trucewith theMoslems^ Somewent northtojoin in thewarwhichwasbeingwagedbetweenBohemond ofAntiochand LeoofArmenia'. Otherswerestill in'Akkawhen provided for in Saladin's treaty (p. «86, n. 3). The statement of Roger Hoveden iv. a8 that Sidon was captured during the crusade may refer to its occupation on the march to Beirut or to some modification of the arrangement regarding its revenues. He is equallymisleading in other statements regarding this crusade (see p. 300, n. I). ^ Sunday night 10th Muharram 595, i.e. Saturday night 7ind November 1198 (A.S.

Then, suddenly, pestilence broke out and further operations during that summer became impossible. Next year (1204) the news of the fall, of Constantinople caused a perfect exodus of crusaders and of Syrian knights to Greece. In the circum- stances it was the obvious policy of the Latins to make peace again. El-'adil was willing and ready to make concessions. No doubt he was alarmed by the fall of Constantinople and appre- hensive of a fresh crusade. Jaffa was restored to the Latins and Nazareth again handed over to them. The division of the revenues of Sidon and of other districts was modified in their favour^ The terms were agreed to in September 1204^ and the truce was to last until the summer of 1210*. Early next year Amalric II died (ist April 1205). Hugh,his son, succeeded him in Cyprus, but the heiress of Jerusalem was a daughter of his wife, queen Isabel, by Conrad of Montferrat. In 1208 the young queen, whose name was Maria, was betrothed to John of Brienne. Their marriage took place in 'Akka in September 1210 and soon afterwards John was crowned king by the patriarch in Tyre. When the truce with El-'adil expired in the summer of 1210 the Latins refused to renew it even for a few months, until John's arrival, as the sultan proposed^ But the ^ Eraclesii. 259f.=Ernoul 354f. 2I.A. ii. 96 (Nazareth and the revenues of Sidon) ; Abulf. iv, 212f, and Makrizi (JaffaandtherevenuesofLudand Ramla). 3 Eracles ii. 263=Ernoul 36o=Sanutus ii. 204f.

His boldest undertakingwasthe landing of 1 100 men near Damietta for a few days in May 121 1^ The raids of the Latins in Palestine merely served to reveal how impotent they really were. El-'adil stationed some troops at Jebel et-tur, under his son El-mu'azzam of Damascus, and these sufficed to keep the garrison of 'Akka in check'. The Latins were compelled to recognise the futility of their efforts to make war without assistance from Europe. In the spring or the summer of 1212 peace was renewed for another period of five years'. The history of Antioch continues to be largely independent of the course of events in southern Syria. Conflicts with the Armenian king Leo the Great are more prominent than wars with the Moslem states. The alteration in the balance ofpower produced by Saladin's attack may be measured by the success with which Leo dominated the policyofAntioch for many years. In pursuance of his plans he seized Bohemond III and made him a prisoner in the year following Saladin's death (1194). Bohemond soon accepted Leo's terms and a marriage was arranged between his eldest son Raymond and Leo's niece. After Raymond's death (1197) it was further agreed that Rupen, a child of this marriage, should inherit both Antioch and Armenia, Leo having no sons ofhis own. But Bohemond's second son, afterwards Bohemond IV of Antioch, who had been ruler of Tripolis since 1187, objected to the arrangement. He asserted his own claims and when his father died, in 1201, ' Hist.

I20I-I9 BOHEMOND IV AND RUPEN 299 successfully established himself in Antioch. This was the commencement of a long-continued struggle. Leo endeavoured to enforce the rights of his grand-nephew Rupen. Antioch was besieged and changed hands more than once. Theknights Templars were on Bohemond's side, the knights Hospitallers on Leo's. Ez-zahir of Aleppo was a faithful ally of Bohemond's, so that the Armenians waged war with a combination of Latin and Moslem enemies\\\\ Leo's greatest triumph was gained in the beginning of 12162, when the Armenians occupied Antioch for the second time. Rupen was now maintained in power for nearlyfour years. After Leo's death, however, in 1219, he failed to make himself king in Cilicia and so lost Antioch also. Bohemond now ruled Antioch and Tripolis for fifteen years longer (1219-34), at peace with the Moslems for the most part, but still carrying on a bitter feud with the knights of the Hospital. The practical independence of the Hospitallers and their territorial claims, especiallyin Tripolis, multiplied occasions of conflict and disputed If there was no longer civil war, there was almost no co-operation against the neighbouring Moslem states. The earlier civil war in Antioch and the later divisions ^ InA.H.599 (ends9thSeptember 1203) Antiochwasthreatened byLeo(Makrizi ix. 125; cf. Gestes 16, Leo occupies Antioch for four days in 1203); in September 1204, Muharram 601, andalsolaterinthe year, Leo attacked Antioch and Ez-zahir came to Bohemond's assistance (Kem. Blochet 141f.); inDecember 1205,Jumadai 602, Leo attacked the neighbourhood of Darbassak which was a dependency of Aleppo (Kem.

Both Bohemond III and Bohemond IV found it to be to their advantage to maintain peace with Aleppo throughout the whole period oftheir government. Neither the crusadeof 1197* nor that of 1203\\\" affected the situation in the north, except to a very slight extent. Bohemond IV found Ez-zahir of Aleppo a useful ally in his Armenian wars and appears only once to have come into conflict with him, during an expedition against the castles of the Assassins in 1214'. The emirs of northern Syria, being El-'adil's vassals, were to some extent committed to his policy of peace with the Latins. Not one of them was individually powerful and everyone was suspicious of his neighbour and of their overlord, the sultan. Ez-zahir merely governed Aleppo and its neighbourhood. Hama was ruled by Nasired-din Muhammed (i i9i-i22i),son of Taki ed-din 'Omar, and Homs by Asad ed-din Shirkuh the younger (i186-1240), grandson of Saladin's uncle Shirkuh. The Latins, accordingly, had little to fear from their Moslem neighbours in the north. In fact it was only the raids of the Hospitaller knights of Hisn ^ AboutthetimeoftheLatinoccupationofBeirutEz-zahirorderedthedestruction ofthefortificationsofJabalaand Laodicea,fearingthat they mightbeoccupiedbythe Latins. The alarm was groundless, and what had beendestroyed was rebuilt (Kem. Blochet ia6ff.= ix. 214ff.; cf. Annales Colonienses in Mon. Germ. xvii. 805). Arnold of Lul)eck (Mon. Germ. xxi. 207) says Bohemond [III] visited the latins in Beirut and he supposes that he took possession of Jabala and Laodicea on his wayback, havingfound them deserted. Cf. Hoveden iv. j8 (thesetowns \\\"captured\\\" bytheChristians). Bohemond was in friendlycommunication with the Moslems of Aleppo at this very time (Kem. Blochet 127). Regarding Jubail see p. 195, n. 6.

Ez-zahir was succeeded byhis son El-malik el-'aziz Giyathed-din Muhammed (1216-36), who was a mere child at the time. His atabek Shihab ed-din Tugril was governor of Aleppo for many years^ From 1218 onwards heacknowledged the supremacyofEl-ashraf, a son of El-'adil whose possessions werechieflyin Mesopotamia^ The occupation of Constantinople by the Latins and the opportunities for adventure and advancement thereby offered to the knights of western Europe undoubtedly diminished the number of crusaders to the Holy Land. But the children's crusades of the year 1212 are evidence of the strength of the religious motive which still swayed the hearts ofthe mass of the people. Innocent HI also remained faithful to his ideals and was unwearied in his efforts on behalf of a new crusade. In 1213 he formally renewed his appeal to Christendom. Two years later the Lateran council (1215) sanctioned and enjoined ^ Duringthesummer of 1203 (Ramadan 599) the emir of Hama twice engaged successfullywiththe Hospitallersof Tripolis (Abulf. iv. 202, Makriziix. 126, 127f.).

In A.H. 601, ends 17th August 1205, peace expired and the Hospitallers made a raid against Hama before itwasrenewed (Abulf. iv. 212, Makrizi ix. 134f.). In A.H.603 (A.S.

Pope Innocent died in 1216but the event did not seriously affect the numbers of those who took part in the crusade. Austrians and Hungarians were most numerously represented. They landed in Palestine in the autumn of 1217. Hugh of Cyprus and Bohemond ofTripolis joined the crusaders in 'Akka. There were the usual discussions and disagreements. Supplies of food were got with difficulty and the Syrian Latins suffered discourtesy and ill-treatment from those who came as their defenders. Several movements of minor importance were made before the end of the year. A strong force raided the dependencies of Damascus for about a fortnight. The invaders proceeded directly from 'Akka to Baisan, where they made rich booty. They then crossed the Jordan^south of Lake Tiberias and moved north-eastwards in thedirection of Khisfin and Nawa. El-'adil was watching them and fell back on Ras el-ma. Before returning to 'Akka they seem to have advanced further north and to have spent three days in the neighbourhood of Banyas. The inhabitants of Damascus were greatly alarmed and very apprehensive ofbeing attacked. But the expedition was a mere raid in search of plunder^ Soon afterwards a badly-planned attack on the Moslem fortress situated on Jebel et-tur was triumphantly repulsed by the garrison and lasted only a week''. Before Christmas an expedition of five hundred crusaders into the hill country near Sidon cameto a disastrousending'.

In the beginning of 1218 in spite of all persuasion to the contrary and in spite of the patriarch's threat ofexcommunication he left 'Akka, taking with him all his ships and men and materials of war. The condition of his kingdom and the state ofhis health weretheexcuseswhich he gave. The king and patriarch occupied the remainder of the winter in erecting a strong tower at Caesarea and the Templars strength- ened and enlarged their fortress of 'Athlith. This latter now became the principal stronghold of the order in Syria. In the spring of 1218 the strength of the crusade was further diminished by the departure of some who returned home, but was greatly increased by a fleet of Germans who came chiefly A from the province of Cologne. council of war was held at which it was decided to attempt the conquest of Egypt. Damietta, a seaport on one of the eastern branches of the Nile, was chosen as the best point of attack. The Latins landed on the 29th of May^ In front of the city, in mid- stream, was a tower connected with the town by a bridge and by a chain or several chains, which prevented ships from ascending the Nile. Assaults on this tower completely absorbed the attention and efforts of the besiegers until the 25th of August, when at length it was captured'^. News of the disaster is said to have caused El-'adil's death (31st August 1218)^ But neither the death of the sultan nor the capture of the tower exercised much influence on the course of events. El-'adil was succeeded in Egypt by his son El-malik el-kamil Nasir ed-din Muhammed and in Damascusbyhis second son El-malik el-mu'azzam Sharaf ed-din Tsa.

El-kamil lay with an army a short distance higher up and effectually guarded a bridge by which the Latins might have crossed to the eastern side. The annual rise of the river and the ravages of disease increased the difficulties of the invaders. It was not until February' that a fortunate circumstance secured them a footing on the other side of the Nile. El-kamil discovered a plot amongst his emirs and secretly left his camp one night. When this became known next morning the Egyptian troops retreated in a panic and left the way clear for the Latins. The city was nowcloselyinvested and slowly starved intosurrender. El-kamil was reinforced by his brother El-mu'azzam and resumed his position in the neighbourhood. He made frequent and vigorous attacks on the besiegers,but without gaining any notable success. In September^whenthe position ofthedefenders becamecritical, he entered into negotiations with the Latins. But the terms he offered were rejected*.

Many of the crusaders, indeed, having discharged their vows, returned to Europe. King John and the papal legate quarrelled regarding the possession of the town and the division of the spoils. When these questions were settled the king sailed to Cilicia where a war of succession was in progress. Maria was dead and John had married adaughterofLeothe Great, so thathis child by this marriage had a claim to the throne. Others of the knights left for Syria, where El-mu'azzam attempted next year to create a diversion (1220). In this to some extent he succeeded. The town of Caesarea was evacuated and laid in ruins. The castle of 'Athlith was twice attacked but unsuccessfully. During the siege of Damietta the Moslems had destroyed the walls of some ofthe places they held in Palestine and this work of destruction was now carried further^ There was great alarm in Egypt and the movements of the Tartars in Mesopotamia just at this time were an additional cause ofanxiety. El-kamil was still disposed to make concessions for the sake of peace. But even his most favourable offers were not accepted. They included the re- storation of Jerusalem and the surrender apparently of at least the revenues of a large part of Palestine^. Meantime the papal legate urged an advance from Damietta and was supported by the enthusiasm ofmany pilgrims who had freshlyarrived from Europe. In 1221 the importance ofstarting before the rising ofthe Nile was urged and recognised. But by ^ Oliver, Eck. ii, 1422 (Jerusalem, Safed andJebel et-tur); cf- de Vitry, Z.K.G. xvi. 74 =Guizot 393 (Jerusalem, Safed, Shakif, Banyas).

El-kamil was posted at Mansura where his front was protected by the Bahr Ashmun, a branch of the Nile which the Latins would have to cross on their way. Theemirsofnorthern Syria,includingEl-ashraf,hadjoinedforces with the Egyptians in the early part of the year\\\". At Fariskur, three miles from Damietta, the Latins mustered 4CXX) bowmen, 1200 knights and a large number of mounted men, besides in- fantry. Their advance from there to the Bahr Ashmun occupied a week. As they marched along the right bank of the Nile in close order they were only slightly harassed by Moslem attacks. On the 24th ofJuly theyencamped in the trianglethat is formed by the Ashmun and the branch of the Nile that flows past Damietta. Further advance was impossible in the face of the enemy and a fortified camp was accordingly constructed. The danger of the position soon became apparent. The ships sent to Damietta for provisions were cut off on their return journey, being captured or sunk (i8th August). The Moslems having gained the river at once blocked the lines of communication by land also. In a few days the Latins came to the conclusion that they must endeavour to force their way back to Damietta (Thursday 26th August)'. It was arranged to start at nightfall. \\\"The tents were set on fire as if to inform the enemy of the retreat and to invite them to awake and pursue us*.\\\" It was altogether a hopeless undertaking. By next morning the main body, on the shore, was surrounded and cut off from the river and from the ships which carried most of the provisions. The sluices of the Nile were opened and the country was flooded. » King John returned from Syria on Wednesday, 7thJuly (Oliver, Eck. ii. 1417, the day after Tuesday \\\"in octava Aposiolorum\\\"); on the 17th ofJuly(i6th Kal.

They sent envoys to El-kamil on Saturdayto request terms ofsurrender. The sultan thought it best not to press his advantage unduly. After the necessaryconsultations and interchange ofmessagesexceedingly moderate terms were agreed to and embodied in a treaty, which was signedon Mondaythe 30thofAugusts Thechiefprovisions were that Damietta should be surrendered, the prisoners on both sides set at liberty and the duration of peace fixed for a term of eight years2 or until the arrival of a western king^ This last condition was understood to apply particularly to the emperor Frederick II. Damiettawas surrendered on the 8thof September (I22l)^ Frederick II of Germany took the crusaders' vow in 1215, on the day when he was crowned king. During the siege of Damietta he gave energetic support to the movement in Europe but he found it inconvenient to leave his dominions at the time himself In 1221 he sent reinforcements to Egypt and madepre- parations to follow them. His failure to carry out his intention was publicly reproved by the Pope as a cause of the disastrous issue of the crusade. In 1222 it was arranged that he should marry Isabella daughter of king John of Jerusalem, who was heiress to the kingdom through her mother. The marriage was celebrated in November 1225 and Frederick thereupon claimed the title king of Jerusalem in virtue of his wife's lineage and in spite ofher father's protests. Extensive preparationswere com- menced for a crusade which was to start in the summer of 1227. But again, at the last moment, the emperor's departure was postponed on account of the state of his health.

When Frederick protested that he was ready to start the Pope for- bade him. In those circumstances the emperor sailed in June 1228, and having spent some time in Cyprus asserting his claim to the island and arranging for its government, he landed in •Akka on the 7th of September^ The course of events in Syria since the peace of Damietta may be very briefly summarised. Affairs in Cyprus had been productive of much internal strife among the Latins. The jealousies of El-'adil's sons had led to frequent wars among the Moslems. Although Tripolis and Antioch were not included in the peace neither party had much leisure even for the border warfare which was usual in the norths The crusaders who left Europe in 1227, when Frederick should have sailed, did not open hostilities in Syria. Many returned home when they learned that Frederick had postponed his departure but about 800 knights and 10,000 foot soldiers remained, awaiting his arrival*. On the 28th of October it was decided to proceed at once to fortify Caesarea and, after this work was finished, to strengthen Jaffa in the same way\\\\ The pilgrims seem how- ever to have worked at several points throughout the winter. The Teutonic knights Hospitallers were occupied in building * Vigilofthe NativityoftheVirgin (Mt. Parisiii. 159).

This proceeding was really a breach of the conditions of the truce, for the town was jointly inhabited by Moslems and Christians, or at least the revenues of the district were divided between them, and the walls were left in ruins in order that neither side might gain undue ad- vantage^ Jaffa was still untouched when Frederick arrived in Palestine. Frederick'srelationsbothwiththe Christiansand theMoslems were nowsomewhat peculiar. He broughtwithhim onlya small number of his own followers. He soon discovered, if indeed he wasnotpreviouslyaware,thathecouldnotdependon thesupport either of the crusaders or of the Syrian Latins. The Pope sent wordthathis leadershipshouldnotberecognised. The Templars and the knights of St John held aloof. The supporters of John ofBrienne and ofthe recentlydeposed governor ofCyprus, John of Beirut, were his enemies. It is probably significant that the fortification of Jaffa was the only military operation that he undertook. This was not his own plan nor was it carried out by his authority. It occupied the Latins from the 25th of November to the beginning of March^ But by this time 1 Annales ii. ii. 438 and Haithum i. 485 mention its building under the year 1226. Frederick's letter of March 1229 possibly implies that it was then still unfinished (Mt. Paris iii. 175). The castle is called Kurain by Arabic writers. 2 Eracles ii. 365 =Sanutus ii. 211.

The datewhen the fortification ofJaffawas completedmay be inferred from the fact that FrederickvisitedJerusalem (after theworkwas com- pleted) on the 17th of March. Hermann's letter (in Mon. Germ. Legum ii. 263) says that Jaffa had been strongly fortified by Sexagesima Sunday (i8th February). Further additions to the fortifications were also contemplated (Gerold's letter iii.314\",\"310 FREDERICK II AND EL-KAMIL A.D. 1 227-28 Frederick had negotiated a treaty with the Moslems on his own authority and without consulting those who were generally most important in such affairs,the masters of the militar>'orders and the papal legate,whowas Ceroid the patriarch ofJerusalem. The emperor's intention to make an expedition to Palestine was well known beforehand to the Moslems. El-kamil actually sent envoys to negotiate with him in Europe. There can be no doubt that he offered concessions in Palestine at the expense of his brother El-mu'azzam, similar probably to those he was previously willing to grant to the crusaders in Egypt. Frederick seems to have thought that the sultan might perhaps restore the whole kingdom of Jerusalem as it had been before Saladin's victories. It is incredible that El-kamil should have entertained such an idea at any time and, besides, the situation in Moslem Syria immediately before and after Frederick's arrival had altered very much to the sultan's advantage. His great rival El-mu'azzam of Damascus died in the latter part of the year 1227 (i2th November)^ and Palestine was occupied by an Egyptian army in the summer of 1228^ Damascus remained in the hands of El-mu'azzam's son El-malik en-nasir Da'ud, whose claims were at first recognised by his uncle El-malik el-ashraf, sultan of Euphratesia and overlord of northern Syria. About the end of November (1228), however, El-ashraf agreed that El-kamil should retain Palestineon condition that Damascus should be conceded to himself. The assurance of the Moslem sultans that Frederick was not a serious menace to theirschemes may be inferred from the fact that El-ashraf now commenced the siege of Damascus and devoted himself to this undertaking 107).

It is not surprising, then, that the course of the negotiations between the sultan of Egypt and the emperor did not run smoothly. They com- menced immediately after Frederick's arrival^ and they lasted, with one slight interruption^ for five months. During the earlier part of this time the emperor was encamped near 'Akka from the 25th of November onwards he was at Jaffa. Possibly the proposal to fortify Jaffa was a consequence of the discovery that a settlement could not be speedily attainedI The stages of the negotiations can only be conjectured. Presumably the final agreement lay between the extreme proposals at first made by each side*. Frederick had no means of enforcing his demands. During the winter, also, he heard that his presence was much required in Europe, where his enemies were taking advantage of his absence. On the other hand, the siege of Damascus made no progress and there was a danger that the emperor might ally himself with El-malik en-nasir Da'ud. A large degree of friendly feeling and mutual respect between the sultan and the emperor and their respective envoys may also have influenced the result. Both princes were eminently men of culture, and unlike most of their contemporaries re- markablytolerantofdifferences ofreligiousopinion and practice. ^ Gerold's circular letter in Mt. Paris iii. 180; representatives of the emperor landed before the fortifications of Sidon were complete and they had already had interviews with the sultan (Ernoul i6of.)' 2 When the Latins began the fortification ofJaffa theyseized supplies fromthe adjoiningvillages. Thesultancomplained of this and of thewhole undertaking as beinginconsistentwith thecarryingonofnegotiations. Frederickgavecompensation forwhat had been taken byforce, but the sultan broke off negotiations for ashort time andharassed the crusadersbycutting off stragglers (Gerold's letter tothe Pope iii. 103, ascitedp. 312, n. 4). 3 Cf.

Most ofthe special articles embodied concessions by the sultan to the emperor. The outstanding feature of the treaty is the provision that Jerusalem should again become a Latin town. But the mosques on the temple hill and the whole sacred area are excepted and a free right ofpilgrimage is expressly provided for*. Bethlehem and Nazarethwere also handed over to the Latins and the roads to Nazareth and Jerusalem were made secure by the surrender of certain villages on the way'. Other concessions were the fortress of Tibnin, the town of Sidon and part at least of the surrounding district*. The most important provisions yet un- * Frederick's letter in Mt.

Hermann's letter ii. 264). El-'aini ii. 189, quoting the tarikh Baibars, Makrizi ix. 545 and Cerold's comments all emphasise the fact that thecasalia roundJerusalem were to be Moslem.

The Christians expressed no gratitude for what they gained they never weighed their chances of ; being able to obtain more by other means they regarded the ; treaty as a shameful compromise and a base surrender. The Moslems gave themselves over to bitter lamentation with more excuse. They were not consoled by the reflection that they still might freely visit Jerusalem on pilgrimage, that the sur- render did not greatly affect the military situation and that for ten years the Latins ofthe south were bound to neutrality when there was war in Tripolis or Antioch. The shameful fact re- mained that Jerusalem had been betrayed and that the holy places were voluntarily given over into the hands of infidels. Both the sultan and the emperor, accordingly, suffered much abuse and, in Frederick's case at least, actual insult. As soon as the emperor visited Jerusalem it was placed under an inter- Geroldiii. 105assertsitwasnot tobe fortified.

Having made what arrangements he could for the government of his eastern kingdom he sailed on the ist of May^ leaving behind him a mixed legacy of benefit and of strife. In spite of the dislike with which the treaty of 1229 was regarded on both sides it was soon practically accepted as a good working arrangement. At first, while El-kamil's authority in Palestine was not secure, Moslem discontent found vent in riotous attacks upon the pilgrims in Jerusalem and on the roads to the holy places'. But this was merelyan ebullition ofpopular feeling, easily dealt with and quickly suppressed. After the reconciliation of the Pope and the emperor, in the summer of 1230, all parties agreed to recognise accomplished facts. Antioch and Tripolis being as usual outside the scope of the treaty, the military orders had still an outlet for their activity in this direction. During 1229-31, for a few months in 1233, and again in 1235-37 there were conflicts with neighbouring emirs, especi- ally on the borders of Tripolis*. But once more internal party ^ Theemperor'svisit lastedfrom theeveningof Saturday 17th March totheearly morningofthefollowing Monday. TheaccountofGerold'sletters (op. cit. iii. 109ff. and Mt.

Frederick's interference in eastern affairs inaugurated a period of bitter civil strife in Cyprus and in Syria. His temporary reconciliation with the Pope did not eradicate the enmity with which many regarded him. John of Beirut led the opposition. The emperor sent forces to maintain his rights under the command of Marshal Richard Filangieri. Cyprus was soon completely lost to the imperial party. In 1232 *Akka also was taken from them. In 1234 Theodoric, arch- bishop of Ravenna, was sent to deal with the situation as papal legate. But the Pope's relations with Frederick again took a turn for the worse and no agreement was reached. The schism in the state continued although hostilities on both sides were suspended. John of Beirut died in 1236 and was succeeded by his son Balian. Marshal Richard remained as Frederick's deputy governor ofhis Syrian kingdom. During all this time the Moslem sultans took no advantage of the discord which prevailed amongst the Latins. El- mu'azzam's son El-malik en-nasir Salah ed-din Da'ud was com- pelled to surrender Damascusto El-ashrafin the month following Frederick's departure (25th June 1229)^ He was permitted to retain possession of the Jordan district (El-gor) and of certain territories to the east of the Jordan (El-belka,including Kerak)2, (Eraclesii. 403ff.). In 1235 (AnnalesA ii. ii.439) or 1236 (AnnalesB ii.ii.439) the militaryordersattacked Barin. In Rabi' i634 (November 1236) El-'aziz of Aleppo died andwasnominallysucceededbyhis son, El-malik en-nasirSalah ed-din Yusuf, a child threeyearsold (Abulf. iv. 418). In the autumn of 1236(ina.h. 634, which commences 4th September 1236) Bagras was besieged by the army of Aleppo in retaliation for recent inroads of the Templars. After peace was restored by the mediationof Bohemond ofAntiochthedeathofEl-*azizbroughtittoanendandthe Templars planned anexpeditionagainstDarbassak. InJune 1237, whilstthe Latins were besieging this place, the army of Aleppo attacked and defeated them very severely (Kem. Blochet 195f., Abulf. iv. 420f., Mt. Parisiii.4040\\\".), ^ LA.Kamilii.176(Monday2ndSha'ban626); A.S.v.190 (MondayistSha'ban 626); Makrizix. 251 (istSha'ban626). Da'udleftthecityon Friday 12thSha'ban, 6thJuly(A.S.

Even El-ashraf formally recognised his brother's supremacy and surrendered several Mesopotamian towns in exchange for his new capitaP. El-kamil thus became the most powerful Moslem prince in Syria and Euphratesia. By a series of successful wars he established his authority and rounded off his territories. Gradually the jealousies aroused by his success came to a head. El-ashraf himself was on the point of leading a general revolt when he died in the summer of 1237. This event gave El-kamil an opportunity of seizing Damascus (7th January 1238)^ and thus of further strengthening his position. When, however, he himself died two months later (loth March 1238)' there was no one capable of holding his dominions together. After several changes and vicissitudes of fortune El- kamil's brother El-malik es-salih *Imad ed-din Isma'il ofBa'albek gained Damascus (27th September 1239)* and one of El-kamil's sons, El-malik es-salih Nejm ed-din Ayub, became sultan of Eg^pt (17th June 1240)*.

Just in the midst of the changes and troubles that followed El-kamil's death the truce between Frederick and the sultan expired and a new crusade arrived in Syria (September 1239). Theobald, count of Champagne and king of Navarre, was its most important leader. It was considered a favourable oppor- tunity for the rebuilding and fortification ofAscalon, which had lain in ruins since 1192. On the way a party ofseveral hundred knights set out to surprise the Moslems in the neighbourhood of Gaza. The result was a serious disaster. The Latins were themselves surprised and practically cut to pieces (13th Novem- ber 1239)^ The main body of the crusaders arrived too late to be of any assistance. They were so discouraged by the defeat that they returned forthwith to 'Akka. Before this the Latins had commenced fortifying Jerusalem and had constructed a citadel in which the \\\"tower of David \\\" was included. Da'ud ot Kerak, who commanded the Egyptian forces in Palestine, at once followed up the victory at Gaza by attacking this new stronghold. It was carried by assault after twenty-one days siege (7th December 1239)''and the tower ofDavid was captured six days later. TheLatins made no attempt at rescueand Da'ud withdrew after he had ruined the defences of the town. In the midst of these misfortunes the rivalry of the Moslem sultans gave the Latins a welcome advantage. As soon as Isma'il of Damascus learned that Ayub had become sultan of Egypt (June 1240) he recognised the menace to himself Damascus had been in Ayub's hands during the early part of 1239 and had been taken from him by Isma'iP.

He promised to surrender Safed and ShakifArnun and portions of the districts of Sidon and Tiberias^ From the sequel it appears that the project was taken up and carried throuf^h on the Latin side by the knights Templars, and accordingly it was to them that Safed and Shakif Arnun were surrendered*. Ac- cording to agreement the allies joined forces at Jaffa, where the frontier was most exposed to attack (summer 1240). There however the knights Hospitallers initiated a policy which con- flicted with that of the Templars and quickly turned the discord of the rival orders into an open breach. The prisoners taken at Gaza, including the Master of the Hospital, were captives in Egypt, and the most certain way ofsecuring their release was to make a compactwithAyub. Theplan commended itselfeven to many of those who had been parties to the treaty with Isma'il, amongst others to Theobald, who had also signed the treaty with Damascus. The supporters of the new alliance left the camp at Jaffa and returned to *Akka^ In any circumstances Theobald might reasonably wish to return home at the season of the autumn passage, which was now approaching. But the difficulty of uniting the Syrian Latins in any common policy is said to have hastened his departure.

Immediately after Theobald left, the arrival of an English crusade under Richard duke of Cornwall introduced fresh com- plications (8th October)^ Richard at first stood neutral between the rival orders and their respective policies^ After having brought the correspondence with Da'ud to a conclusion, without any practical result, he united all parties in favour of a pro- posal that Ascalon should be fortified. At Jaffa, on the way to Ascalon, the Latins were met by ambassadors from the sultan of Egypt,who declared his willingness to make peace. Richard now threw in his lot with the supporters ofan Egyptian alliance, and this policy was duly sanctioned by a majority of the Latin chiefs^ Terms were drafted and dispatched from Ascalon on the 30th of November\\\". The envoys were detained in Egypt for nearly two months. But finally, on the 8th of February, they brought word that the sultan had agreed to their proposals and sworn to observe the treaty^ The concessions obtained by the 1 Richard'sletter (Mt.

The de facto possessions of the Latins, including Ascalon and the surrenders lately made by Isma'il, were also duly recognised. If, besides this, there was any promise to surrender Moslem territory, the places mentioned were in the possession of Isma'il and not really in Ayub's power to dispose of-. So far as the new treaty confirmed and supplemented the agreement with Damascus it was clearly to the advantage of the Latins. In fact, however, it conflicted inevitably with the earlier treaty, and as the policy merely of a party it could not and did not provide a settlement of the situation. The Templars adhered to their alliance with Isma'il and the troops of Damascus were still stationed on the south-western frontier near Ascalon*. After the departure of Richard and his fellow-crusaders in the spring the balance of power between the parties was materially altered, and the vitality of the alliance with Damascus soon became apparent. Meantime the joint work of fortifying Ascalon had made good progress, and after the completion of a double wall with towers and defences the crusaders returned to *Akka.

The Hospitaller house in 'Akka wasblockaded once at least bythe Templars and on another occasion practicallybesieged forsix months byBalian of Beirut. In the summer of 1243 the anti-imperialist party captured Tyre and so the supporters of the alliance with Damascus gained the upper hand. By this time it was ap- parent that no acquisition of territory was likely to result from the Egyptian alliance and the way was prepared for the accept- ance of new proposals by Isma'il. In May 1242 the knights Templars and their Moslem allies defeated an Egyptian army on the borders of Palestine. The Egyptians lost heavily and were driven back to Gaza, which was their base of operations^ After this Ayub made terms with Da'ud of Kerak^ and nego- tiated with the Templars also^*. In the autumn an expedition from Jaffa surprised and plundered Nablus (31st October)* and in retaliation Da'ud, to whom Nablus belonged, raided the neighbourhood of the Latin town at the head of troops from Gaza^ In 1243 Isma'il nearly came to an understanding with his rival Ayub, but suspicions of his good faith finally induced ^ Annalesii.ii. 240, naming \\\"le Nasser,\\\"i.e. Da'ud of Kerak, as theTemplars' ally; Mt.

The correct date is no doubt Dhu'l-ka'da 639 (May 1242). There is a reference to this same battle in Abu'l-mehasin (Kem.

Da'ud of Kerak preferred the friendship of Damascus to that ofEgypt,and after some hesitation and delay the joint overtures ofthe new allies were accepted by the Latins (beginning of the summer of 1244)'. Isma'il gave up the re- mainder of the revenues of Tiberias, surrendered all control of Jerusalem and acknowledged the title ofthe Latins to Ascalon''. He also promised further concessions in Egypt if that country should be conquered^ The Latins on their part broke off all friendly relations with Egypt and pledged their support to Isma'il. Thus the policy of the Templars was triumphant. Ayub was now faced by the prospect of invasion and threatened with the loss of his dominions. In his trouble he found allies in an unexpected quarter. The Kharismian Turks had recently been driven from their homes by the Tartar in- vasion and were ready to put their swords at the disposal of the highest bidder. At the sultan's invitation an army of 10,000 horsemen* swept through Syria in the summer of 1244. Having ravaged the territories of Damascus they entered Palestine and swarmed over the land. Jerusalem was invested for a few weeks and fell into their hands without much resistance (23rd August 1244)'. All the south of Palestine was occupied and the Latin coast towns were in great alarm. The sultan of Damascus and his allies were pledged by treaty to give their help against any Moslem invader and doubly bound to play a part in this development of the struggle with Egypt. Isma'il, Da'ud of Kerak, and the emir of Homs joined the Latins at * Letterin Mt. Paris iv. 307; cf. Abulf. iv. 474 (before the end of a.h.641, i.e. 8thJune 1144) and Makrizix. 357.

The Turks were already united to an Egyptian force of 5000 men under the command of a mamluk emir, Rukn ed-din Baibars. The opposing forces met near Gaza and the ensuing battle was one of the mosr decisive in the history of the crusading states (17th October 1244)^ The Moslems who occu- pied the centre and the left wing of the Syrian army broke and fled as soon as they were attacked^ The Latins on the right held their ground, but only to suffer grievous defeat. The extent of the disaster may be estimated from the fate of the military orders. Of three hundred Templars and two hundred Hospitallers engaged in the battle thirty-three or thirty-six Templars and twenty-six Hospitallers alone escaped. The others were killed or taken prisoners^ The Master of the Temple was amongst the slain and the Master of the Hospital amongst those taken captive. The prospects of the Latins were now dark in the extreme. They had no army left and the troops of Ayub and of his Turkish allies ranged over the country without fear of further opposition. Ayub indeed was still on friendly terms with the emperor Frederick and in communication with him. But the emperor was more than ever alienated from the Pope and from those who now controlled the policy of the Syrian Latins. Ayub refused to release his prisoners or to make any compact or even to listen to any intercession except that of the emperor. Thus the only means ofreconciliation were such that the Syrian Latins either could not or would not avail themselves of them. Fortunately Ayub had still to deal with his Moslem rivals Isma'il and Da'ud, and this gave the Latins a limited respite. ^ Chron. Mail. 163.

After a six months siege, which extended over the summerof 1245, Damascus surrendered to the sultan'sarmy (ist October)^ Shortly afterwards the Kharismians being dissatisfied with the share of plunder which Ayub had assigned them turned against him. Isma'il endeavoured toprofit by this opportunity. Supported by Da'ud and the Kharismians he attacked Damascus in the summer of 1246'. But fortune still favoured his rival. The Turkish army was defeated by a relieving force which came from Homs and Aleppo. From this time neither Isma'il nor the Kharismian Turks play any important part in Syrian politics. The Latins rejoiced with good reason at the removal of a terrible scourge. But another peril from the north was already threatening them. In this same year the territories of Antioch were invaded by the Tartars and Bohemond V (1234-52)' was forced to pay them tribute*. In 1247 Fakhr ed-din Yusuf ibn esh-sheikh commanded the Egyptian army which operated in Palestine. Probably in the early part of the year he ravaged the territory of Da'ud and took possession ofhis strongholds with the exception of Kerak\\\". Then he turned against the Latins. His ready success measures the feebleness of his opponents. Tiberias was occupied on the 16th of June and Ascalon was captured towards the end of October*. Next year the approach of a new crusade and troubles in northern Syriaalternatelydistracted Ayub's attention. Homs wasbesieged fortwomonthsand captured by the army of El-malik en-na.sir of Aleppo.

He reached Damascus on the 19th of November^ The sultan of Aleppo refused to come to terms and Ayub's emirs laid siege to Homs whilst their sovereign lay seriously ill in Damascus. When the issue of the struggle was still doubtful, in order perhaps to secure union against the crusaders or to have time to make preparations for the defence of Egypt, Ayub concluded peace with El-malik en-nasir and left Homs in his possession. He was carried back to Egypt in a litter and arrived there in the latter part of April (1249)2. The last crusades on a large scale were due principally to the piety of one man and to the resources of the kingdom over which he ruled. Louis IX, Saint Louis king of France, took the crusaders' vow in the year 1244. It seemed for a time as if Christendom might be stirred again to a united effort on behalf of the Holy Land. Great sums of money were raised by the efforts of the clergy and the Pope, and the emperor Frederick pledged himselfto support the project. But the quarrel between the popes and the emperor had gone too far to admit of any reconciliation. The crusade which actually started in the summer of 1248 was predominantly a French crusade, initiated and carried through by the devotion of the king himself. The winter was spent in Cyprus and there it was decided that the A invaders should land in Egypt. most encouraging success was gained at the very outset. Moslem troops under the command of Fakhr ed-din were stationed in a camp on the western bankofthe Nile opposite Damietta and facing the shore where the Latin ships cast anchor on the 4th of June (1249). But when the crusaders landed next day the Moslems were repulsed and hastily retired in the direction of Cairo. This so discouraged the garrison and population of Damietta that the town was abandoned during the following night and the morn- ing of the next day. Thus the Latins occupied the city ^ istSha'ban646 (A.S.v. 194); cf. IbnKh. iii. 246 (beginningofSha'ban646). • 2 Commencementofa.h.647 (Makrizi,App. 531).

But the season of the Nile floods was at hand and it was decided to wait until it was past^ Five months were thus spent in Damietta to no positive ad- vantage. The stagnation was relieved somewhat by Moslem attacks and by skirmishes in the neighbourhood of the town, but nothing of importance to either side resulted from these engagements^ Ayub's long illness terminated with his death (21st November)* a few days before the Latins commenced to advance on Cairo. But the event exercised no influence on the course of the war. It was concealed, as far as possible, for three months, during which Fakhr ed-din commanded the Egyptian army in the interests of Ayub's son Turan shah, who was summoned at once from Hisn kaifa. Starting from Damietta the Latin army followed exactly the route of their predecessors in the campaign of 1221 and the history of the two campaigns is otherwise remarkably alike.

For six weeks they laboured at the construction of a causeway by which they hoped to cross the river. But the sheds in which the builders worked were burned, the river was widened at the other side by the digging down of the banks and the crusaders' camp was harassed by Moslem attacks from the direction of Damietta. Finally the Latins were informed of the existence of a ford some distance offand on the 8th of February (1250)^ in the early morning, all the available mounted men, in three divisions, were sent round this way. So far the movement was successful. The river was crossed, the Moslem camp was taken by surprise and Fakhr ed-din lost his life in the confusion of the first attack. When, however, the knights of the first division rashly charged into the streets of Mansura they were completely cut to pieces. At the end of the day the Latins had indeed secured a footing on the southern side ofthe Ashmun, but their effective cavalry force was greatly diminished and the Moslems joyously celebrated at least a partial victory. As in 1221 matters came to a crisis when the Egyptians deprived the Latins of their command of the Nile and so cut the lines of communication with Damietta. On the 15th ofMarch they made an important capture of Latin ships and from that time the river was in their hands^ Scarcity of provisions, disease and the perpetual attacks of the enemy gradually made the Latin position intolerable.

The rank and file remained meantime in captivity and half the ransom was still due^ While most of the crusaders now returned home Louis resolved to remain in Palestine. The duration of the peace with Egypt had been fixed at ten years^ But there was so much delayin the restoration ofthe captives and oftheproperty which had been left in Damietta that the Latins became sus- picious of the good faith of the mamluk emirs. It was felt that peace was byno means secure and that it would greatlyconduce to the fulfilment of the treaty and to the general interests of the countryif Louis postponed his departure. The king allowed his brothers to return home in August and sent with them a letter to the nobles and clergy of France appealing for reinforcements to retrieve the situation^ The fact that war was on the point ofbreakingout between the Moslems of Syria and theEgyptians raised Louis' hopes and improved his position. El-maliken-nasir of Aleppo, having taken possession of Damascus (9th July 1250)^ attempted the conquest of Egypt during the following winter.

In March 1251 he commenced the fortification of Caesarea and remained thus occupied for a year^ In the last week of March 1252 Egyptian envoys brought word that his terms had been accepted'. The king's deputies were permitted to make free search in Egypt for all Christian captives and to claim their release. For those who were the slaves of private owners Louis paid compensation^ It was arranged that the Latins and the Egyptians should join forces by the middle of May\\\" and Louis moved to Jaffa expecting the Egyptians to occupy (iaza. In this, however, they were anticipated by the troops of Damascus and the proposed union ofthe allies proved impracticable\\\".

When the army of Damascus on its way homewards through Syria raided the territory of the Latins they quickly realised the danger of their situation. It was resolved to fortify Sidon, which had suffered particularlyat the hands ofthe enemy. A retaliatoryexpedition against Banyas had no great success. The task of fortifying Sidon occupied nearly eight months, until the beginning of Lent in the following year\\\\ Before its completion Louis had resolved to return to France. It was clear that no reinforcements were coming from Europe. The death of the queen-mother Blanche, who had acted as regent in France, removed the chief supporter of Louis' projects at home and made it otherwise desirable that he should return to his own kingdom. Peace was concluded withthesultan ofDamascus for a period oftwo years, six months and forty days, dating from the 21st of February2. When the king sailed on the 24th of April (1254)^ Geoffrey of Sergines, with a few knights, remained as his representative. King Louis' stay in Palestine had lasted nearly four years. His reputation as king of France was no doubt ofservice to the country, but as he never had more than 1400 men under his command in Palestine^hewas quite unableto taketheaggressive. Hence the part he played as a mere negotiator and fortifier of cities. It was very largely the discord between Egypt and Damascus which gave him even such a part to play. After Louis' departure therewas abriefrenewal ofthe Moslem quarrel in 1255 and this led to the conclusion ofa formal treatybetween the Latins and the mamluk sultan, Aibek^ Jaffa and the neighbourhood were expressly shut out from the operation ofthe treaty, and thehostilities in this district led to some infraction of the peace in 1256. It was renewed, however, in the same year onthe same lines as before*'.

Probablytherewas also a treaty with Damascus', so that for some years the Latins were again practically at peace with their Moslem neighbours. As so often in their previous historythis intervalwas devoted to the waging of bitter civil war. In 1256 a quarrel broke out between the Genoese and the Venetians and soon every party in the state was involved in the struggle. The jealousy of the militar)'^orders,thepersonal quarrelsofBohemondVI of Antioch (1252-75) and the contest for the empty title of king of Jerusalem all embittered and complicated the strife. Whilstthe war raged by land and sea thousands lost their lives, and the walls of the Latin towns were battered down by those who should have been the foremost to strengthen and build them up (1256-60). In Egypt, meantime, the mamluk sultans firmly established their position. The household troops of the sultan Ayub, his mamluks or foreign slave-guard, discovered their power after their master's death, during the troubles which accompanied the Latin invasion of Egypt. Shortly after Louis* defeat the mamluk emirs, having assassinated Turan shah (2nd May 1250)', openly assumed the government of Egypt. A few months later they conferred the title of sultan upon Aibek, one of their own number, henceforth known as El-malik el-mu'izz (1250-57). During their struggle with the \\\" legitimist\\\" claimant El-malik en-na.sir of Damascus, they strengthened their position by associating with Aibek a sultan of the house of Saladin. But this was only a temporary expedient. En-nasir's failure to conquer Egypt has already been spoken of In 1255 some of the mamluk emirs, including Rukn ed-din Baibars, became ' Presumablyitwas renewed after Aibek's death (laj?) andagainafterhisson's deposition (1159).

In 1258 Bagdad was captured and the last of the caliphs put to death by these northern invaders. In 1259 Khan Khulagu invaded northern Syria at the head of a numerous army. El-malik en-nasir proved altogether unequal to the demands of the situation.

About the loth of August* he entered Syria at the head of an Egyptian army. Khulagu had been called away to the north but the Tartar generals in command gathered their forces at 'Ain Jalut. After a desperate fight, in which the tide of battle was turned by the personal bravery of the sultan, and after a vain attempt of the Tartars to rally their broken forces at Baisan, a complete victory was gained by the Moslem army (3rd September)^ Damascus was occupied by the victorious troops a few days later (8th September)', and all the tributary towns which En-nasir had governed speedily submitted to the conqueror. Not only was the victory at *Ain Jalut decisive of the final expulsion ofthe Tartars from southern Syria*, it paved the way again for a reunion of Moslem Syria under the sultan of Egypt. But Kutuz did not live to enjoy the fruits ofhis success. He was assassinated by Rukn ed-din Baibars, who had entered his service when he became sultan and to whom he had now refused the governorship of Aleppo. The event took place as the sultan returned to Cairo (23rd October 1260)'^ and that very day Baibars was proclaimed sultan by his fellow conspirators. — The accession of Baibars marks the commencement of a ' further stage in the history of the holy war. At last the policy of Saladin is resumed by one whose untiring energy and far- sighted statesmanship remind us of his great predecessor, however much his perfidy and cruelty set a gulf between their ' Abulf.iv. 594 (beginning of Ramadan 658, which commences on the loth of August); Menko's Chron. xxiii. 549 \\\"mense Augusto imminente.\\\" According to Makrizii. i. 103 KutuzleftCairoon Monday 15thSha'ban (25th July).

The new sultan was just the man to use to thebestadvantagetheopportunities ofhis situation. Egyptian troops captured Damascus (January 1261) from a governor who refused to acknowledge Baibars' title. Thus southern Syria was secured and the work of organising and strengthening the military resources ofthe sultanate proceededwithout perceptible interruption. Baibars skilfully strengthened his position by welcoming to Egypt a descendant of the caliphs of Bagdad, whose authorityhe acknowledged andpledged himselfto support (June). In the autumn he visited Damascus and received the submission of Aleppo (October). During a few weeks stay in the north he showed his animosity to the Latins by ravaging the territory of Antioch. He encouraged the caliph to attempt the recovery of Bagdad from the Tartars, but did not find it expedient to give his expedition much supports Bohemond of Antioch had been and still was on friendly terms with the Tartar invaders- so that Baibars' policy towards him was one of uncompromising hostility. His early relations to the Latins of the south are not so clear. The change of sultan coincides with a fresh outbreak of hostilities between the Moslem and Christian populations of Palestine^ At least one expedition on a considerable scale may be dated in the year 1261^ The knights Templars of 'Akka, Safed and other places whilst raiding the Jaulan together were attacked by Turkomans and severely defeated.

An agreement with Jaffa and Beirut was signed on both sides, but the negotiations with the military orders and with the other Latin towns broke down over certain details. Doubtless in order to emphasise his resolve not to yield on the points in dispute Baibars ordered a raid to be made on the territories of the Latins whilst he himself returned to Egypt'. During 1262 it may be supposed that the relations of the Moslems and the Christians of Palestine remained the same as in the previous year. It was like the lull before the storm, significant to all but the most inexperienced. The sultan remained in Egypt during the whole year. He was actively engaged in diplomatic intercourse with the rulers of Europe and the Moslem east. Mention may be made especially of the friendly relations which he cultivated with the emperor Michael VIII (1259-82) who had just recovered Constantinople from the Latins (1261). In the north of Syria the troops of Aleppo joined in the Tartar war which was still raging in Mesopotamia. During the summer they also made a most successful incursion into the territory of Antioch. The seaport of the capital was burned and the ships in the harbour were destroyed'. During 1263 Baibars' movements are those of a general who surveys his field of operations and tentatively ascertains the strength and disposition of the enemy. He entered Palestine about the beginning of March with the immediate result that the count of Jaffa, who had long promised the release of his Moslem slaves, hastily executed his agreement for the sake of peace\\\".

A college in Cairo known as Ez-zahariya, from the sultan's official title, was completed and opened on Sunday December gth^. The hostilities of the year 1264 were still of a minor character. The sultan remained in Egypt consolidating his power and completing his military preparations. In northern Syria, although the Tartars were still a disturbing factor and minor conflicts with the Latins took place, the Armenians were the most active enemies of the Moslems.

But as soon as news came south that this enemy had retreated before the troops which were sent against them Baibars in person commenced an attack on the Latin towns. Caesarea was taken by surprise on the 26th of February and the city was stormed'. The inhabitants retired to the strongly fortified citadel, but that also surrendered a week later after a vigorously conducted siege (5th March)'.

The Latins who were still a thousand strong surrendered on condition that their lives should be spared, and the town wasplundered and its walls destroyed. Baibars was now resolved to pursue his conduct of the holy war with as little intermission as possible, but for the next steps extensive preparations were required and the cam- paign was not resumed until the following year.

For ten days in the beginning of May he ravaged the country and broke into the weakest of the strongholds where the inhabitants took refuge. The districts of Safitha and Antartus were spared in consideration of the release of three hundred prisoners. Proceeding north by Homs and Hama the Moslem army divided into scattered bands which plundered the territory of Antioch and then united for the siege of the capital. The invaders approached the town on the i6th of May^, driving back at the same time a sortie of the garrison. One or two days were spent in fruitless negotiations.

Everything left over was given to the frames^ Bohemond happened to be in Tripolis and so escaped the disaster which befell his capital. He had no remedy of any kind for the situation. Evidence of the new prestige of the sultan may be found in the readiness with which Haithum of Armenia now came to terms.

It still suited the sultan's policy to maintain peace with some of the Latin towns and no doubt he did so^ But others such as Tyre being, as it were, marked down for conquest were given no truce.

The five years at the close of.^ Baibars' sultanate,during which he was at peacewith theLatins, were principally occupied by campaigns against the castles of the Assassins, the kingdom of Armenia and the ever dangerous ^~~ Tartars. With the death of El-malik ez-zahir Rukn ed-din Baibars a notable figure in this history passes from the stage. His share in the reconquest of Syria from the Latins was made apparently easy by the extreme weakness of his opponents, while it was in reality greatly complicated by wars with other peoples and by the difficulty of holding together his own dominions. His success must be attributed chiefly to his own personal qualities._ Even the treachery and the cruelty which mark his career had their uses. His rivals never got the chance ofbecoming danger- ously powerful. The most prominent of his better qualities is certainly his untiring energ>'. His swift secret movements were the wonder of his subjects. He had all the qualities of a brave soldier, a competent general and a clear sighted statesmap. He was a patron of art and literature, a restorer of mosques and a builder of fortifications. It cannot be maintained that he was beloved by any class of his subjects, but his valour and success gained him respect and fear. His capture of Antioch is itself sufficient to preserve his memory, and his achievements against the Latins will always shed lustre on his name. Baibars was succeeded by one of his sons,whomade himself very unpopular and abdicated after a sultanate of two years (17th August I2yg)\\\\ His successor was a brother who was deposed in three months by Saif ed-din Kalawun (26th Novem- ber 1279)'. The claim of the new sultan to his title El-malik el-mansur, the victorious prince, was soon severely tested and brilliantly established. Another emir, Sunkur el-ashkar, pro- claimed himself sultan of Damascus early in 1280. In June Kalawun's forces gained a victory which gave them possession ofthat city. Thereupon the defeated emir called the Tartars to * 7th Rabi'ii678 (Makrizi i. ii. 171). Perhapsthe dateshouldbeten dayslater (Weil iv. Ill,note i). ' Makrizi (Sunday 10th Rajab 678).

Whilst the Tartars delayed their advance southwards Kalawun came to terms with as many as possible of his actual or prospective enemies. Treaties were made with the knights Hospitallers of 'Akka (3rd May 1281), with Sunkur el-ashkar himself(endofJune) andwith Bohemond ofTripolis (i6th July)^. Sunkur kept the possessions he already had and received in additionAntioch, Famiyaand Kafrtab^ The truce with the Latins was to be for ten years, ten months, ten weeks and ten days^ Having collected all his forces and completed his preparations the sultan now advanced towards Homs (October 1281). A battle was fought with the Tartars in the plain of Homs on the 30th ofOctober^ Mangutimur, a son of Khulagu, was the Tartar commander. This was the only invasion of Syria by the Tartars during Kalawun's sultanate. The left wing ofboth armies was routed. But the Moslem right and centre, acting together, after a prolonged struggle gained a decisive victory. Whilst the Latins were thus at peace with the Moslems for a full decade their domesticquarrels ragedwiththeold persistence. ^ They were in Aleppo from the i8th to the 20th of October, 21st to 23rd Jumada ii 679 (Makrizi ii. i. 26). 2 The dates are given by Sanutus ii. 228 (along with a reference to an earlier successfulexpeditionof theknights in 1278).

A quarrel between the Templar knight Guy, lord of Jubail, and Bohemond VII had serious issues. The order of the Templars became involved and the two factions waged a rancorous civil war. In 1282 Bohemond gained Jubail and Guy died in captivity. When king Charles was involved in the troubles arising from the Sicilian vespers (1282) Hugh reasserted his claim to authority in Palestine (i283)». After Hugh's death (1284) and that of his son John (1285), Henry II, another son, became king. After the defeat of the Tartars at Homs, Kalawun still showed himself disposed to remain at peace with his Latin neighbours. Baibars' truce with the Templars of Antartus was renewed for another term of ten years and ten months (15th April 1282)'. It was provided that the fortifications in the district should not be added to nor strengthened. When the truce that applied to 'Akka, 'Athlith, Sidon and the dependent districts came to be renewed the Latins appear to have supposed that they might secure better terms than those of the expiring treaty. But the agreement actually ratified was simply a re- cognition of the status quo (3rd June 1283)^ The Latins were debarred from adding to their fortifications except in the towns of 'Akka, 'Athlith and Sidon. Security was guaranteed to all pilgrims on the way to Nazareth, going and coming, and the church of Nazareth and four houses beside it were reserved for their use. In 1285 peace for the usual period of ten years and ten months was concluded with Marguerite ofTyre (i8th July)*. It renewed the provisions of the treaty with Baibars and pro- vided that no additional fortifications should be constructed in Tyre. * Makrizi ii.i. 63f. maybe a reference tothisandnot to events connectedwith the Latinwar. \\\" Wednesday 5th Muharram 681 (Quatremire's Makriri ii, i. 111).

The knights of Markab appear to have attacked a caravan of merchants and this brought them into collision with the emir of Hisn el-akrad. Kalawun gladly seized the opportunity of destroying this nest, which was alwayshatchingtroubleon the borders. The Moslem siege of the castle lasted thirty-eight days, until both sides wel- comed acapitulation, the Hospitallersbecausetheysawthattheir position was becoming indefensible and the sultan because he wished to preserve the walls from utter ruin (25th May 1285). The garrison were conducted under escort to Tripolis and were permitted to take with them all the property they could carry away^ Kalawun now menaced the strong tower of Marakiya by the sea and so terrified Bohemond of Tripolis by his threats that he persuaded the governor to hand it over to the Moslems. By them it was immediately destroyed2. Nodoubt these events contributed to induce Marguerite of Tyre to make the treaty already referred to. In the same summer Leo of Armenia (1270-89) agreed to pay an annual tribute, and peace was granted him on this condition. The death of Bohemond VII in the autumn of 1287 (19th October)^ created a situation in Tripolis which finally resulted in a renewal of the Moslem war. Bohemond had no surviving children so that his sister Lucia was his heir. Her claim was opposed by a party whose leaders obtained assistance from the Genoese and corresponded with Kalawun^ A period of disturbance and almost of anarchy, although not quite of civil war, was the consequence. Possibly the treaty of 1281 expired with the death of Bohemond^ In any case the uncertainty 1 Fullest particulars are given bythe life of Kalawun in Reinaud 548f.

The year 1288 passed without fulfilment of his intention owing, it is said, to the death of his son*. By the time he appeared before Tripolis, in the spring ofthe follow- ing year (25th March)', the Latins had made some preparations for their defence and were united in face of the common foe. Butthe vigour with which the Moslems pressed thesiegequickly brought it to a successful issue (26th April)*. Nineteen si^e engines and 1500 sappers and miners were employed in the attack. When the town was stormed many lost their lives and many were taken prisoners, but many also escaped by sea as the sultan had no fleet. After this rapid success Kalawun does not seem to have pressed his advantage. The governor of Jubail, head of the party opposed to Lucia, promised tribute and was left undisturbed\\\". Antartus was protected by special treaty. Otherplaceswhich had been Bohemond's were probably of thecontractingpartiesshouldnotnullifytheobligations of theother.

The fall of Tripolis unmistakably presaged the future. The Latin towns were evidently at the mercy of the sultanI Their onlyhopewas that Europewould respond to the Pope'sappeal on their behalf But such a hope was altogether vain. King Philip of France disclaimed responsibility of any kind. The kings of Aragon and Sicily, who were brothers, hastened to make an alliance with Kalawun. They signed a treaty which bound them to assist the sultan against any crusade and against the Syrian Latins if they broke the existing truce (24th April 1290)*. Edward I of England had dallied for some years with thequestion of another crusade and seemed disposed to execute his promises. But his intentions really mattered little. The great debateofeast and west wasover beforethe timeappointed for his crusade. The efforts of the Pope induced some hundreds of pilgrims, it may have been a thousand or two, to cross to *Akka in the summer of 1290, and their presence hastened the catastrophe.

Some of them committed outrages on Moslems who lived securely near *Akka under the pro- tection of the existing treaty (August 1290)'. When Kalawun was informed he demanded the surrender of those who had thus violated the truce. Some, including the Templars, advised sub- mission. But the reply actually made was a refusal, tempered by protestations of various kinds. Kalawun atonce commenced preparations for the siege of 'Akka. In the very midst of his activity, after a few days illness, he died on the night of Friday loth November (1290)'. The event made no apparent change in the situation. El-malik el-ashrafSalah ed-din Khalil, his son and successor, rejected the overtures of the Latins (January 1291)' and actively continued the preparations for war. The army which assembled before 'Akka in the spring of 1291 was chiefly formidable because of its artillery. Its siege engines numbered ninety-two, more than were known to have been employed at any previous siege*. Probably the number ofthe troops was also exceptionally great\\\".

Those who could send their wealth and their wives and children to Cyprus did so. Such knights and soldiers as were notlegally bound to remain deserted the city in large numbers*. But the garrison still numbered 12,000 men, and of these 800 were knights^ After ten days bombardment preparations were made to storm the town.

The Moslems filled the moat at a vulnerable point and, having seized the ramparts, made a breach by which they entered the city. Accusations, against the Latin leaders, ofdis- cord and of failure to discharge their duty were afterwards current, and the walls at the captured point are said to have been imperfectly manned. Howeverthis may have been, a rally led by the Marshal of the knights of St John, Matthew of Clermont, turned the tide and drove the Moslems once more from the city. That night a temporary wall was built behind the breach and engines were posted to protect it. Next day the Moslems seem to haverested in preparation for their final effort\\\". The last assault took place on Friday the i8th of May'. The attack began before sunrise,when the city was shrouded in mist. By the first breach and the neighbouring gate and finally at various other points the Moslems penetrated within the walls. Early in the fight the Master of the Temple was killed and the Master of the Hospital severely wounded. Many of the leaders, including king Henry*, escaped by the ships which remained in the harbour. But for most there was no escape. Numbers took refuge in the strongholds of the city, such as the Templar-house,and there defended themselves for ten or twelve days longer. The incidents ofthese closing days are left to our imagination to picture. When the last fight was over and the city had been plundered the fortifications were dismantled and the houses set on fire. In the spring of 1291 the Latins still retained some half-a- dozen towns along the coast ofSyria, from Antartus to 'Athlith. The fall of 'Akka sealed their fate without exception.

Tyre was abandoned on the evening of the i8th of May by its principal Christian inhabi- tants, and next day the Moslems took possession. When a Moslem fleet appeared off Sidon on the 14th of July the Latins deserted the town. The citizens of Beirut capitulated as soon as they were summoned to surrender (21st July)^ The towns of Tripolis were perhaps the last to be taken possession of by the victorious enemy. Antartus was occupied on the 3rd of August^ and the others presumably about the same time. The Templar castle of 'Athlith, which had been deserted in May, was destroyed about the middle of August^ The news of the complete extinction of the Latin colonies was received without great interest or emotion in the west. Pope Nicholas IV duringthe remainingmonths of his life vainly tried to kindle into flame some sparks of the old enthusiasm. After his death even the project of a crusade faded gradually away. The alluring ideals of the first crusade had lost their power after two hundred years' experience of the possibilities and real character of a European occupation of Palestine. ^ Particulars are givenbyGestes 256fF. and Sanutus ii. 231f.,but exceptinthe case of Tyrewithout dates.

THE CHRONOLOGY OF THE ARABIC HISTORIANS. The Arabic histories of the period of the crusades are not bare chronicles, but they follow the chronicler's method of relating the events of each year together in a group under the heading of the year in which they occur. This method, in spite of its chronological advantages, creates and perpetuates chrono- logical error. Every event which the historian records must be put under some year and inevitably there are cases where the evidence is insufficient and the wrong year is chosen. Besides, strict adherence to the method is often sacrificed to avoid the breaking off of a narrative at an inconvenient point. In such cases the historian may overrun the year slightly or may carry part ofhis narrative forward,or may recapitulate when he comes to resume it under the next year. In any case his readers are sometimes misled regarding the year inwhich someofthe events recorded took place. Incidents which fall at the beginning or end of Moslem years are evidently most likely to be taken a year forward or set a year back (see pp. 102, n. i and 301, n. i). The general result is that independent sources frequently relate the same event under different but successive years. This has a further important consequence. Such writers as Ibn el-athir, Sibt ibn el-jauzi, Kemal ed-din, Abu shama and Makrizi, for the periods anterior to themselves, are compilers from older sources. Abu shama names his sources and indicates the beginning and endofhisquotations. Theothersasa rule transcribewithoutany acknowledgmentthat theydoso. They copy theirsources nearly word for word and even set down contradictory statements,from different sources, side by side, without remark or any solution of the contradictions. Such a procedure leads to the appearance361\",\"CHRONOLOGY OF ARABIC HISTORIANS 357 in their histories of what may be called \\\"duplicate narratives,\\\" two accounts of the same events, taken from different sources and possibly assigned to different years (see pp. 46, n. i, 62, n. 2, 85,n. 7, ioi,n. 5, 103, n. 5, 108, n. 4, 297, n. 3, 321, n. i). When the accounts of the earlier sources diverged considerably and were entered under different years it might easily escape the compiler's notice that he was incorporating duplicate narratives in his history. In anycase his method and the conditions under which he worked produced such duplicates and, whether aware of it or not, he gave his readers no warning. The result is that battles and treaties and sieges walk again as new events when they are really ghosts, revenants, of what has been enacted previously. It is not surprising that modern historians should have been betrayed by these phantoms into describing events which never occurred. Even the most notable work of recent years on the history ofthe crusades is not free from error ofthis kind. The Moslem year consists of twelve lunar months^ which in the course oftheir progress through the solar year correspond in turn to(parts of)allourwesternmonths. Since the astronomical lunar month (\\\"lunation\\\") is not an exact number of days the commencementofthese Moslem months and theirduration have been fixed according to a system which keeps them as closely in touch with the phases of the moon as is consistent with their having an exact number of days in each. In every cycle of thirty years the system is ahead of actual lunar time in only a very few years by as much as 5-8 hours, whereas, roughly speaking, in 10 out of 30 years it is behind the phases of the moon by 7-16, 8-17, 9-18, 10-19 and even by 11-20 hours. The Christian dates correspondingtothe Moslem months ofany year are given in Wiistenfeld's tables in accordance with this system (see bibliography). These dates maybe called\\\"calendar dates\\\" and are quite fixed (e.g. ist Muharram 494 = 6th November iioo, and ist Muharram 495 = 26th October iioi). ^ Muharram...30 days Jumada i...30 days Ramadan 30 days Safar 29 ,, Jumadaii...29 ,, Shawal 29 „ Rabi' i 30 „ Rajab 30 ,, Dhu'l-ka'da...30 ,, Rabi' ii 29 ,, Sha'ban ...29 „ Dhu'l-hijja ...29or30days362\",\"CHRONOLOGY OF ARABIC HISTORIANS 3S8 But in practice this calendar systemis notstrictlyfollowed. The commencement of every month is determined by observation, which varies from place to place, and may be at least a day sooner or later than the\\\"calendar date.\\\" Fromthe natureofthe calendar actual observation should usually give dates that are earlier than the corresponding calendar dates, but the difficulty of observation in unfavourable climatic conditions is such that the divergence ofactual dates from calendar dates is generally on the sideoflateness. It follows from these circumstances that variationsofoneortwo days between the dates ofArabicwriters for the same event are usually caused by variations in the assumed date of the commencement of the month in which the event falls. The 13th of Rajab in one writer is the same as the 15th ofRajab in another (p. 261, n. 5). The 5th, 6th and 7th of Rabi* ii may all denote the same day (p. 151, n. 4). The Arabic historians were perfectly aware of this imperfection in their system of dating and in order to prevent uncertainty they regularly name the day of the week along with the day of the month (p. 315, n. i). Where the week day is wanting in Moslem dates, owing to the neglect of copyists or otherwise, there is no certainty regarding the actual day and no presumption in favour of the calendar date. When the actual date is known to be different from the calendar date it is usually a day later and it may be two days. It is more rarely a day before the calendar date and seldom, if ever, two days. Apparent instances of this last variation (e.g. p. 116, n. 2) may possibly be explained otherwise. The debt which the present writer, like all students ofthe crusading period,owes to the great\\\"Recueil des historiens des Croisades\\\" makes it the more necessary to warn those not acquainted with Arabic that the dates of its translation must always be tested. They are only calendar dates at best, and when the editors observe discrepancies between the month dates and the days of the week they are inclined like Rohricht to correct the latter instead ofthe former (pp. 140, n. 6, 302, n. 2). When Moslem dates are given in terms of the Christian calendar an element of uncertainty sometimes arises owing to the fact that the Moslem daybegins at night and so includes the night of the preceding Christian day. When it is not known363\",\"CHRONOLOGY OF ARABIC HISTORIANS 359 that a certain event took place at night, or when being known it is not allowed for,the calculated Christian datewill be a day too late (pp. 151, n. 4, 268, n. 4). A very large number of discrepancies in the dates given by the Arabic authors are simply due to textual error. By far the most numerous classofsucherrors are those caused byconfusion between the Arabic words for 10 and 20, the written forms of which are closely alike. This confusion affectsall the compound numbers from 11 to 29 and is therefore a potential cause oferror in most month dates. It is hardly an exaggeration to say that the cases where two dates differ by 10 days are innumerable. The discrepancy occurs between different sources (p. 230, n. 3), and between different texts of the same source (pp. 230,n. 3,263, n. 7). In every case the explanation is that the Arabicword for 10 has been read and written 20 or vice versa. When the weekday test is available it arbitrates decisively between the readings. Sometimes the parallel dates of western sources also point out the true text (p. 267, n. 3), occasionally an Arabic source suppliesa Christiandatewithwhich comparison may be made (p. 286, n. 3) and sometimes there are incidental indications of the error and of the required correction in the narrative itself(pp. 151, n. 4, 230, n. 3, 266, n. i). Less easily understood and yet apparently occurring are instances of the addition of the number 10 to the units so that I becomes 11, 2 becomes 12, etc. (pp. 151, n. 4, 234,n. 5, 329, n.6; cf. p. 302, n. 2). Possibly such errors arise partly from the use of figures. There are certainly cases of textual error which originate in the misreading and miswriting ofthe Arabic figures. 5 and 9 are evidently sometimes confused owing to their resemblance (pp. 213, n. 3, 226, n. 3), and so perhaps are 5 and o (p. 229, n. 2). 3 and 8 are still more commonly interchanged (pp. 286, n. 3, 316, n.4) but the resemblance ofthe Arabic words for these numbers may be held chiefly responsible for this. Some apparent cases of the confusion of 7 and 9 do not admit ofquite decisive proof. In the Arabic historians the names of the months are also seriously affected by textual error. It is obvious how simply Rabi* i and Rabi' ii may be confused, although the numeral is364\",\"360 CHRONOLOGY OF ARABIC HISTORIANS regularly written out and not denoted by a figure (p. 350, n. 4). Similarly Jumada i and Jumada ii (pp. 235, n. 2, 333, n. 4), Dhu'l-ka'da and Dhu'l-hijja (pp. 333, n. 2, 352, n. 2) and frequently Shawal and Sha'ban (pp. 286, n. 3, 339, n. 4, 345, n. i) are wrongly interchanged. In p. 194, n. 3, a clear case of Jumada i for Rabi' i is given, but this is exceptional. The Arabic sources for the period of the crusades supply most valuable and abundant chronological data,buttheirliability to textual error in the case of mere month dates is so great that some verification is always desirable. The principal criterion of accuracy in such cases is the weekday test and that is usually quite suflficient in itself In quoting Arabic dates it is always important that the week day should be included when it is named in the sources. Fortunately the names of the days of the week are textually distinct, so that they are not themselves appreciably affected by textual error. There may be cases where the week day named is inaccurate, but comparatively speaking they are very rare (pp. 296, n. i, 303, n. 3). Where the discrepancy between a week day and a month date disappears on the assumption of a prevalent textual error in the numeral or in the month there need be no hesitation in making the correction (p. 261, n. 3). No doubt there are cases of what may be called compound errors. There may be two errors side by side in the same date(pp. 194, n. 3,286, n. 3)and conceivably there may be successive errors, as from 9 to 5 and then from 5 to o. Corrections of such cases possess complete certainty only when there is external evidence in favour ofthem. It remainstobeobserved thatthere are frequent discrepancies between the dates assigned to certain classes of events in particular. Sieges and surrenders are typical examples. The commencement of a siege may include several distinct stages, such as the first approach of the enemy, the arrival of all his forces, the complete investment of the town and the opening of the bombardment. Each one of these stages may have a different date, which may appear in some writer as the date of the commencement of the siege. A compiler whose only available date refers properly to one of the stages naturally treats that as his date for the commencement of the siege365\",\"1 WILLIAM OF tyre's CHRONOLOGY 36 (pp. 144, n. 2, 261, n. 5 ; cf. p. 263, n. 3). The capture or surrender of a town may also include similar stages. The negotiations for surrender begin on a certain day, terms are arranged on another, the vanquished evacuate the town or citadel on a third and the conqueror's triumphant entry takes place on a fourth. The date of any ofthese events may appear in the histories as the date of the capture of the town (pp. 209, n. 3, 230, n. 2, 251, n. 6, 334, n. 3 ; cf 212, n. 3). B. WILLIAM OF TYRE'S CHRONOLOGYi. The reigns of which the chronology is here discussed are those of Baldwin I, Baldwin II, Fulk, Baldwin III, Amalric and Baldwin IV. The dates in these reigns are in terms of the years ofthe Christian era or ofthe regnal years ofthe kings, or are determined by reference to the sequence of events, by what may be called a system of relative chronology. There are such serious errors both in the Christian year dates and in the regnal year dates that the question whether these are due to William Tyre himself soon presents itself Investigation shows that many dates of both classes are probably secondary additions to the original narrative. This implies that the system of relative chronology may be treated as representing through- out most certainly William Tyre's original work. Some of the difficulties of the superadded framework, as it may be called, are removable on the assumption of textual error. But this remedy is only a partial one. It does not appear that the question of the time that is reckoned as the commencement of the Christian and the regnal years, respectively, affects appreciably the discussion of William Tyre's chronology. It may be inferred from xii. 8, which refers ^ There is an important article byT. A. Archer on this subject in the English Historical Review, vol. iv. 1889, pp. 89-105. In it he elaborately discusses \\\"the accessiondatesof theearlykingsofJerusalem\\\" as theseare containedin thehistory of William Tyre. But his conclusions areweakened by his omission to investigate thecharacterofthechronologyofthishistoryat otherpoints.

But even if his year commenced at Haster the conclusions here maintained would not be materially affected. The case of the regnal years is more complicated. The historian's usage in the reign of Baldwin IV evidently makes the regnal year commence on the day of the new king's accession. But this does not necessarily hold good of the chronological framework in the earlier reigns. In xiii. 18 it may be held that January 1126, and only that particular month, is put, correctly, in the eighth year of Baldwin 11's reign. But the possibility of the equation A.D. 11 26=eighth year of Baldwin's reign is not to be lost sight of and seems in fact to agree with the usage of the framework, according to which every complete Christian year is denoted by some one corresponding regnal year. In other words the first regnal year of a reign may be reckoned to commence on the 1st of January following the king's accession. In the following detailed discussion the reign of Baldwin IV is passed over as presenting no special difficulties, and a com- mencement is made with that of Amalric as the next latest and as one in which William Tyre himself lived and played a part. The Christian year dates of the deaths of the kings are reserved for separate treatment together at the end. Amalrics reign. Independently of the references to regnal and Christian years, twelve years may be distinguished in the narrative of this reign. The transitions from year to year occur in xix. 6, xix. 11, xix. 13, xx. 3-4, xx. 10, xx. 19, xx. 24, XX. 27, XX. 29, XX. 30and xx. 32. Theyare sometimes expressly marked by the phrase \\\"sequenti anno\\\" (e.g. in xx. 24), some- times they are only to be inferred from the mention of a season (xix. 1 1) or a month (xix. 6) which obviously belongs to a new year. In the following table these twelve years are denoted by Arabic numerals and the regnal yearscorresponding,wherethey are mentioned, by Roman numerals. The Christian year dates of the king's accession and death being meantime reserved, the remaining chronological data ofthe reign are as follows' ' In xix. 10A.I). 1167 isacertaincaseoftextual error,presumablyforA.D. 1165.

Ifthese corrections be made the regnal years of Amalric's reign form a consistent series corresponding uniformly to the years of the relative system of dating and to the three Christian years given above But since the relative dating itselfis in error in the latter part of Amalric's reign (see below) these corrections can only be made with some reserve at this stage. Any estimate of the value of the chronological framework of Amalric's reign must take account of a most damaging fact which appears at the outset. William Tyre's narrative passes in silence over the year 1166, and the system of dating by regnal years takes noaccount of the omission, being constructed on the assumption that the relative dating of the narrative correctly indicates the number of years in the king's reign. xix. 12 is the point at which A.D. 1166 is passed over, and the contents of the chapter heading indicate that William Tyre left this portion of his narrative unfinished with the intention of completing it during revision. The author ofthe framework, if he had known of the omission of A.D. 1166, would have passed from iii° to v'', instead of which he passes from iii° (in xix. 11) to iv° (in xix. 13). In other words these regnal years have not been taken from contemporary records nor from tradition, but have been inserted by calculation and in reliance on the com- pleteness of the relative chronology.

In xx. 23 the year of the death of Thomas a Becket is given as vii° and in xx. 33 the king's own death year is xii°. Both of these are known dates, the former event took place in December 1 170 and the latter in July 1 174 (p. 213). Reckon- ing inclusively there are parts of five successive Christian years between the two events. William Tyre's relativedatingassumes, however, six instead of five, and the author of the framework, whether he be William Tyre or another, falls into the same error. It is again evident that the regnal yeardatesarenot independent traditional data but are part of an artificial system. If this be granted the reserve with which (vii*'), viii\\\" and x° were pre- viously corrected need no longer be maintained. The Christian year dates in the above table do not call for much comment. In xix. 9 August 1165 is certainly a mistake for August II64 (p. 189). Conceivably it might originate by scribal error, but against this supposition stands the fact that as it is it forms a part of a self-consistent whole. It may have been derived by calculation from other parts of the framework. Reign of Baldwin III. Here the system of relative chrono- logy is much lessclearand complete than in the reign ofAmalric. Only thirteen or fourteen years are distinguished, many fewer than the actual number of the years of Baldwin's reign. At some points there is deliberate departure from a purely chrono- logical order and the investigation is considerably complicated by the presence oferrors in William Tyre's representation ofthe sequence of events. There are altogether eight regnal year dates in the present narrative,viz. i°, ii°,ix°,x°, xiv°, xv^ xviii**and xx''in xvi. 6, xvi. 8, xvii. 20, xvii. 30, xviii.^ 14, xviii. 21, xviii. 28 and xviii. 34 respectively'. Criticism is made difficult by the uncertainty regarding Baldwin's accession and death years, as they were in reality and as William Tyre supposed them to be. ix®, x^ xiv° and xv** seem to refer to the events of 1 152, 1 153, 1 157 and 1 1 58 respectively and thus harmonise with one another. It cannot be supposed that they were all obtained by calculation from the relative chronology, so that at least one of each pair * Discussionofxx*isreserved untillater (p. 369f.).369\",\"WILLIAM OF tyre's CHRONOLOGY 365 represents actual tradition. If the series ofChristian and regnal years are not independent of one another it is more likely, in view of the facts already ascertained, that the regnal years are secondary. They reckon 1144 as the first year of Baldwin's reign and so support November 1143 as the date of Fulk's death (p. 147). xviii° is wanting in the Old French translation (Recueil text) and may accordingly be one of the latest additions to the narrative. It stands for the year of Reginald's capture, which has been assigned in chapter IV to November 1160 (p. 183), in accordance with William Tyre's relative chronology. In order to agree with the series ix*^, x°, xiv°, xv*' it should perhaps denote 1161, but in this reign the regnal years do not form a uniform system and of course if it is a later interpolation, as has just been suggested, ithad presumablyan origin different from theirs. i° and ii*' possibly denote theyears 1145 and 1146in harmony with the Christian year dates in xvi. 22ff. which are referred to below. It is not possible to say with certainty whether or not they harmonise with Tyre's relative chronology, which is very inconsistent with historical facts at this point. In any case they are not part of the series ix°, x°, xiv°, xv*^ already referred to. They may be the commencement of an attempt to introduce a series ofregnal dates which was continued by meansof Christian year dates in xvi. 22 ff. orwas given up because of the obscurity of the relative chronology. The narrative of xvi. 8 refers to events which took place in the spring of 1147, but cannot be used to determine the Christian year denoted by ii°, since its position here is due to Tyre's misdating. Apartfrom theyearsofBaldwin'saccession anddeaththereare only six Christian year dates in this reign, and of these five are certainlyerroneous. Inxvi. 22,xvi. 26,xvii. 2and xvii.9, thedates 1146, 1146 (stc), 1147 and 1148 should be 1147, 1148, 1148 and 1149respectively. Inxvi. 26,January 1146maybeatextualerror for January 1147, unless its author included January 1147 in the year 1146. But this correction still leaves the four years in question eachayear too early. In xvii. 30, A.D. 1154iscertainly erroneous (p. 171) but it may not be due to textual error, since Nureddin's capture of Damascus which took place in April 1154 is related previously (xvii. 26). If it be corrected to 1153 and370\",\"366 WILLIAM OF tyre's CHRONOLOGY attributed to William Tyre it follows that he dated the capture of Damascus in 1153, instead of in 1 154. In xvii. 20, A.D. 1152 cannot be controlled because William Tyre is the only authority for the incident related in the chapter. The dates ofthe framework are not so clearly superadded to theoriginal narrative in this reign as they were seen to be in the case of Amalric's reign. But there are so many errors in the Christian year dates and so much inconsistency in the regnal year dates that it seems hazardous to attribute morethan a small proportion ofthem to William Tyre himself. Fulk's reign. In this reign the chronological data are much fewer than in the reigns of Baldwin III and Amalric. Even the relative chronology is less full and exact. Notes of transition from year to year are almost wanting, except towards the close, where it is possible to trace a succession of three or four years. There are only two regnal year dates i° and xi^ the latter being the lastyearofFulk'sreign. Both are wanting in theOld French translation (Recueil text) and the second is a flagrant error (see below). They may be regarded as amongst the latest chrono- logical additions to the text. There is only one Christian year date besides that of Fulk's death, viz. the death year of the emperor John (xv. 23). The event is wrongly dated \\\"anno...! 137, mense Aprili \\\" instead of on the 7th or 8th ofApril 1143. It may be suggested that this is a case of scribal error. \\\" MCXXXVII mense Aprili\\\" being a substitutefor \\\" MCXXXXIIIVII mensis Aprilis.\\\" Thereare similar errors in xviii. 34 and xix. 9. The Old French translation in the former case has taken iv from the month date and made Baldwin Ill's death year xxiv° instead of xx\\\", in the latterithas dropped iv or v from the end ofthe yearand reads MCLX instead of MCLXV. Reigns 0/ thefirst kings. In the reigns of Baldwin I and Baldwin II the relative chronology again becomes full and the Christian years are given with comparative frequency. By combining these data a fairly continuous and consistent chrono- logy may be constructed. The passing over of A.D. 1 106 between xi. 13 and xi. 14 is exceptional. The striking increase ofchronological detail in the earlier reigns may be explained by the assumption that William Tyre here drew on earlier histories,371\",\"1 WILLIAM OF tyre's CHRONOLOGY 367 such as that ofFulcher ofChartres. It is noteworthy, however, thatthereareblanksinhis narrativewhich Fulcher'shistorymight have filled and that in hisrelativechronology and in hisChristian year dates there are discrepancies between him and Fulcher in which the latter has the correct account. As an example of these variations reference may be made to xi. 7, where the invasion of Maudud is related in connection with the events of 1107 or II08 instead ofin connection with those of 1110. There is not much to be said in detail regarding the chrono- logyofBaldwin I'sreign. Inxi.8,A.D. 1109mayonlybeatextual e m rr o or for 1108 (p. 84) and in xi. 13-14 A.D. iiii^ another for (p. 59f), as the relative chronology suggests. In x. 9 the Christmas referred to is certainly that of the year iioo (cf. Old French translation), although it is spoken ofas the Christmas of Iloi (p. 44). The year is wanting in the Old Frenchtranslation and it may not be part of the original text. Curiously enough, however,in Fulcher ii. 5 also (Migne's text) Baldwin's coronation is dated on Christmas Day iioi. The only regnal year date in Baldwin I's reign, xviii'^, is that ofhis death (xi. 31). Reign ofBaldwm II. In this reign there are five Christian year dates and each of them is associated with a corresponding regnal date as follows : ii°=A.D. 1120 (xii. 12-13) = vi<' A.D. 1 24 (xiii. 14) = viii° A.D. 1126 (xiii. 18) = xii<' A.D. 1130 (xiii. 26) = xiii° A.D. 1131 (xiii. 28). Of the Christian year dates 1120^ and 1130 are errors for 1119 and 1129 (see pp. 103 fi\\\". and 128). 1119 is implied by the relative chronology, but the agreement of 1120 with the series of dates as printed above forbids confident assumption of textual error. The year may have been calculated from other members ofthe series as the proper equivalent ofii°. 1130 also might be calculated backwards from the death ofthe king (xiii. 28)on the ^ Inxi.13Mignehas 1112,where theRecueiltexthas iiiiinharmonywithxi. 14. ^ Inxii. 12 the Old French translationand MSS. BandC (Recueil edition) have 18 for 1x20.372\",\"— 368 WILLIAM OF TYRE'S CHRONOLOGY assumption that the events of xiii. 26 occurred in the previous year. If the originality of the (later) regnal years were not so doubtful (see below) it might be supposed that 1 130 was calcu- lated from xii°. Both xii° and 1130 are consistent with the relative chronology. The unreliability of the regnal year dates and their artificial origin are again clearly exemplified in the series which belongs to this reign. If Baldwin's second year be reckoned as be- ginning either on ist January 11 19 or on 7th April 1119 the regnal years corresponding to the Christian dates June August II20, June 1124, December 1130 and August 1131 should be iii°, vii°, xiii° and xiv° instead of ii°, vi°, xii\\\" and xiii** as above. January 1126 (xiii. 18) is correctly in viii® on the second hypothesis, although not on the first. If established dates and only they be made the tests (xii. 12, xiii. 14, xiii. 18) — — June August 1119 is rightly in ii°, June July 1 124 wrongly in vi° and January 1126 rightly in viii° (assuming the regnal year to commence in April). All these discrepancies are removed on the assumption that the above equations rest on a system in which i°=iii9, ii°s=ii20, etc. If this view of the series be correct some of the Christian year dates have clearly been got by calculation (e.g. A.D. 1120). But in the light of previous results it is to be supposed that the regnal year dates are more especially the secondary element. The author of the framework may have had one or two regnal dates given him in William Tyre's narrative (e.g. in xiii. 18) or he may have based his calculations on the information he possessed regarding the king's death year. Given a single equation and two or three Christian year dates he would be in a position to supply all the material that is contained in the above table. The most obscure part of the relative chronology of this reign is at the end, where it is particularly important because of its bearing on the date of Baldwin's death. In xiii. 25 the death of the patriarch of Jerusalem, which took place in 1128 (Rohricht 184, note 8), is put in the same year as the coming of Fulk toJerusalem (.spring 1 129). Conceivably the representation is due to a source which reckoned the spring of 1129 part of373\",\"WILLIAM OF tyre's CHRONOLOGY 369 II28. On this assumption the return of Hugh Payns (in the summer of 1129) is rightly put \\\"anno sequenti\\\" (xiii. 26). But Xhtprimafacie interpretation of the narrative is that the patri- arch died in 1129 and that Hugh came to Jerusalem in 1130. The erroneous date \\\"anno 1130 regni domini Balduini duo- decimo\\\" in xiii. 26 is presumably due to the obscurity of the relative chronology. The error of this chronology, if there be one, lies in the \\\"eodem anno\\\" of xiii. 25 rather than in the \\\"anno sequenti\\\" ofxiii. 26. The kings' death years according to William Tyre. Baldwin I [2nd April] 1118 xviii« (xi. 31) Baldwin II 2ist August 1131 xiii\\\" (xiii. 28) Fulk 15th November 1142 xi« (xv. 27) Baldwin III loth February 1162 xx« (xviii. 34) Amalric nth July 1173 xii« (xx. 33) In considering the errors which are undoubtedly contained in this table due account must be taken of the fact that in its present form it exhibits a consistent scheme constructed on the principles exemplified in the framework of the reign of Baldwin H. Necessary corrections of the Christian year dates cannot be made on the assumption of accidental textual error, unless it isfurther assumed that the regnal year dates have been adapted to these textual errors. The two series of Christian and regnal year dates have been adjusted to one another and neither series can be relied on as supplying purely traditional data. It is certain that Amalric died in 1174 and not in 1173 (p. 213) and that Fulk died in 1143 or 1144 and not in 1142 (p. 147). The deathyears of Baldwin II (p. 130)and Baldwin III (p. 184)areonlydoubtfullycorrect. IfFulksucceeded Baldwin II in August or September 1131 and died in November 1142 his death occurred in the twelfth year of his reign not the eleventh as above, and if November 1142 be corrected to November 1143 or 1144 he died in xiii° or xiv° (and.possibly in xv° if he suc- ceeded in 11 30). xiii°, xx° and xii° may be maintained as the death years of Baldwin II, Baldwin III and Amalric respec- tively, only if we correct the parallels A.D. 1131 and A.D. 1162 to s. c. 24374\",\"370 WILLIAM OF tyre's CHRONOLOGY A.D. II30 and A.D. 1 163. Conceivably the regnal dates of the death years are of more historical value than those already discussed. But the ascertained character of the others does not tend to inspire confidence in these. If we retain the Christian year dates 1131 and 1162, the corresponding regnal dates of the death years of Baldwin II, Baldwin III and Amalric are xiv°, xix° and xiii° respectively. An important fact in connection with the dates of the above table is that several of them do not agree with the relative chronology of William Tyre's history. According to it Fulk's death year appears to be 1144(p. 147). If the deathyear ofthe emperor John was given by William himselfas 1 143 (see above), it is impossible that he should have made Fulk's deathyear 1 142. In Amalric's reign if the death of Thomas a Becket be taken as a fixed point (xx. 23), the death year of the king falls in 1175 (or 1174). The relative chronology of Baldwin II's reign favours 11 30 as the year of that king's death unless its author (William Tyre) supposed that Bohemond II died in 1131. In the case of A Baldwin III the relative dating is ambiguous. year is completely omitted from the history, either just before or just after the death of the king. In the former case Baldwin III died in February 1163, in the latter in February 1 162. In the reigns of Baldwin II, Baldwin III and Amalric there are other equations of Christian and regnal dates which may be compared with the equations for the death years of these kings. The equation xiii° = A.D. ii31 agrees with theotherequa- tions in the framework of Baldwin II's reign. The equations xx° = A.D. 1162 and xii° = A.D. 1173 on the other hand are not parallel to the other equations of the reigns of Baldwin III and Amalric, according to which the former should be 1163 and the latter 1175. It follows from these facts that the author of the framework has constructed his system of death year dates in part independently of the systems he applied to the events of each reign. The last question connected with these dates is what has been the history of their insertion in William Tyre's narrative. It is tempting to attach importance to the complete omission of a date for Fulk's death in the Old French translation. The375\",\"2 WILLIAM OF TYRES CHRONOLOGY 371 equation xi° = A.D. 1142 is the weakest partofthewholescheme and the least likely of the dates to be due to William Tyre himself Presumably some of the Christian dates other than II42 have been retouched by the authorofthe framework in the interests of his system. But if so it cannot be assumed with confidence that the regnal year dates have escaped treatment. It is likely that some of the Christian dates and possibly some regnal dates were included in William Tyre's original narrative. But criteria for determining his share in the death year dates as they stand in the printed texts are not available. — 24376\",\"LIST OF PRINCIPAL WORKS REFERRED TO IN THE NOTES'.
