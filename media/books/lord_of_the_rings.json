In the production of this first volume, Tolkien\\nexperienced what became for him a continual problem:\\nprinter’s errors and compositor’s mistakes, including well-\\nintentioned ‘corrections’ of his sometimes idiosyncratic\\nusage. These ‘corrections’ include the altering of dwarves to\\ndwarfs, elvish to elfish, further to farther, nasturtians to nastur-\\ntiums, try and say to try to say and (‘worst of all’ to Tolkien)\\nelven to elfin. In a work such as The Lord of the Rings,\\ncontaining invented languages and delicately constructed\\nnomenclatures, errors and inconsistencies impede both the\\nunderstanding and the appreciation of serious readers – and\\nTolkien had many such readers from very early on. Even\\nbefore the publication of the third volume, which contained\\nmuch hitherto unrevealed information on the invented lan-\\nguages and writing systems, Tolkien received many letters\\nfrom readers written in these systems, in addition to numer-\\nous enquiries on the finer points of their usage.\\nThe second volume, The Two Towers, was published in\\nEngland on 11 November 1954 and in the United States on\\n21April1955.MeanwhileTolkienworkedtokeepapromise\\nhe had made in the foreword to volume one: that ‘an index\\nof names and strange words’ would appear in the third vol-\\nume. As originally planned, this index would contain much\\netymological information on the languages, particularly on\\ntheelventongues,withalargevocabulary.Itprovedthechief\",\"xii note on the text\\ncause of the delay in publishing volume three, which in the\\nend contained no index at all, only an apology from the\\npublisher for its absence. For Tolkien had abandoned work\\non it after indexing volumes one and two, believing its size\\nand therefore its cost to be ruinous.\\nVolume three, The Return of the King, finally appeared in\\nEngland on 20 October 1955 and in the United States on\\n5 January 1956. With the appearance of the third volume,\\nThe Lord of the Rings was published in its entirety, and its\\nfirst edition text remained virtually unchanged for a decade.\\nTolkienhadmadeafewsmallcorrections,butfurthererrors\\nentered The Fellowship of the Ring in its December 1954\\nsecond impression when the printer, having distributed the\\ntypeafterthefirstprinting,resetthebookwithoutinforming\\nthe authoror publisher.These includemisrepresentations of\\nthe original printed text – that is, words and phrases that\\nread acceptably in context, but which depart from Tolkien’s\\nwording as originally written and published.\\nIn 1965, stemming from what then appeared to be copy-\\nright problems in the United States, an American paperback\\nfirm published an unauthorized and non-royalty-paying edi-\\ntion of The Lord of the Rings. For this new edition by Ace\\nBooks the text of the narrative was reset, thus introducing\\nnew typographical errors; the appendices, however, were\\nreproducedphotographicallyfromthehardcoveredition,and\\nremain consistent with it.\\nTolkien set to work on his first revision of the text so that\\na newly revised and authorized edition could successfully\\ncompete on the American market. This first revision of the\\ntext was published in America in paperback by Ballantine\\nBooks, under licence from Houghton Mifflin, in October\\n1965. In addition to revisions within the text itself, Tolkien\\nreplacedhisoriginalforewordwithanewone.Hewaspleased\\nto remove the original foreword; in his check copy, he\\nwrote of it: ‘confusing (as it does) real personal matters with\\nthe ‘‘machinery’’ of the Tale, is a serious mistake’. Tolkien\\nalso added an extension to the prologue and an index – not\",\"note on the text xiii\\nthe detailed index of names promised in the first edition,\\nbut, rather, a bald index with only names and page refer-\\nences. Additionally, at this time the appendices were greatly\\nrevised.\\nTolkienreceivedhiscopiesoftheBallantineeditioninlate\\nJanuary 1966, and in early February he recorded in his diary\\nthat he had ‘worked for some hours on the Appendices in\\nBallantine version & found more errors than I at first\\nexpected’. Soon after this he sent a small number of further\\nrevisions to Ballantine for the appendices, including the now\\nwell-known addition of ‘Estella Bolger’ as wife of Meriadoc\\nin the family trees in Appendix C. Most of these revisions,\\nwhich entered variously in the third and fourth impressions\\n(June and August 1966) of volume three, and which were\\nnot always inserted correctly (thereby causing further con-\\nfusion in the text), somehow never made it into the main\\nsequence of revision in the three-volume British hardcover\\nedition, and for long remained anomalies. Tolkien once\\nwrote, concerning the revising of The Lord of the Rings, that\\nperhaps he had failed to keep his notes in order; this errant\\nbranch of revision seems likely to be an example of that\\ndisorder–eitherinhisnotesorintheabilityofhispublishers\\nto follow them with utmost accuracy.\\nThe revised text first appeared in Great Britain in a three-\\nvolume hardcover ‘Second Edition’ from Allen & Unwin on\\n27 October 1966. But again there were problems. Although\\nthe revisions Tolkien sent to America of the text itself were\\navailabletobeutilizedinthenewBritishedition,hisextensive\\nrevisions to the appendices werelost after being entered into\\ntheBallantineedition.Allen&Unwinwereforcedtoresetthe\\nappendicesusingthecopyaspublishedinthefirstBallantine\\nedition. This did not include Tolkien’s second, small set of\\nrevisions sent to Ballantine; but, more significantly, it did\\ninclude a great number of errors and omissions, many of\\nwhich were not discovered until long afterwards. Thus, in\\nthe appendices, a close scrutiny of the first edition text and\\nofthemuchlatercorrectedimpressionsofthesecondedition\",\"xiv note on the text\\nis necessary to discern whether any particular change in this\\nedition is authorial or erroneous.\\nIn America, the revised text appeared in hardcover in the\\nthree-volume edition published by Houghton Mifflin on\\n27February1967.Thistextwasevidentlyphoto-offsetfrom\\nthe1966Allen&Unwinthree-volumehardcover,andisthus\\nconsistentwithit.Asidefromthefirstprintingofthissecond\\nHoughton Mifflin edition, which has a 1967 date on the title\\npage, none of the many reprintings is dated. After the initial\\nprintingsofthisedition,whichborea1966copyrightnotice,\\nthe date of copyright was changed in 1965 to match the\\nstatement in the Ballantine edition. This change has caused\\na great deal of confusion for librarians and other researchers\\nwho have tried to sort out the sequence of publication of\\nthese editions.\\nMeanwhile, Tolkien spent much of the summer of 1966\\nfurther revising the text. In June he learned that any more\\nrevisions were too late for inclusion in the 1966 Allen &\\nUnwin second edition, and he recorded in his diary: ‘But I\\nam attempting to complete my work [on the revisions] – I\\ncannot leave it while it is all in my mind. So much time has\\nbeen wasted in all my work by this constant breaking of\\nthreads.’ This was the last major set of revisions Tolkien\\nhimselfmadetothetextduringhislifetime.Theywereadded\\nto the second impression (1967) of the three-volume hard-\\ncover Allen & Unwin second edition. The revisions them-\\nselves mostly include corrections of nomenclature and\\nattempts at consistency of usage throughout the three vol-\\numes. Some small alterations were made by Tolkien in the\\n1969 one-volume India paper edition.\\nJ.R.R.Tolkien died in 1973. His third son and literary\\nexecutor,ChristopherTolkien,sentalargenumberoffurther\\ncorrectionsofmisprints,mainlyintheappendicesandindex,\\nto Allen & Unwin for use in their editions in 1974. Most of\\nthese corrections were typographical, and in line with his\\nfather’s expressed intent in his own check copies.\\nSince 1974, Christopher Tolkien has sent additional cor-\",\"note on the text xv\\nrections, as errors have been discovered, to the British pub-\\nlishers of The Lord of the Rings (Allen & Unwin, later Unwin\\nHyman, and now HarperCollins), who have tried to be con-\\nscientious in the impossible task of maintaining a textual\\nintegrity in whichever editions of The Lord of the Rings they\\nhave published. However, every time the text has been reset\\nfor publication in a new format (e.g. the various paperback\\neditionspublished inEnglandin the1970sand 1980s),huge\\nnumbers of new misprints have crept in, though at times\\nsome of these errors have been observed and corrected in\\nlaterprintings.Still,throughouttheseyearsthethree-volume\\nBritish hardcover edition has retained the highest textual\\nintegrity.\\nIn the United States, the text of the Ballantine paperback\\nhas remained unchanged for more than three decades after\\nTolkien added his few revisions in 1966. The text in all of\\nthe Houghton Mifflin editions remained unchanged from\\n1967 until 1987, when Houghton Mifflin photo-offset the\\nthen current three-volume British hardcover edition in order\\nto update the text used in their editions. In those new\\nreprintings a number of further corrections (overseen by\\nChristopher Tolkien) were added, and the errant Ballantine\\nbranch of revision (including the ‘Estella Bolger’ addition)\\nwas integrated into the main branch of textual descent. This\\nmethod of correction involved a cut-and-paste process with\\nprintedversionsofthetext.Beginningwiththe1987Hough-\\nton Mifflin edition, an earlier version of this ‘Note on the\\nText’ (dated October 1986) was added to The Lord of the\\nRings. This ‘Note’ has been reworked three times since then\\n– the version dated April 1993 first appeared in 1994, and\\nthe version dated April 2002 came out later that year. The\\npresent ‘Note’ replaces and supersedes all previous versions.\\nFor the 1994 British edition published by HarperCollins,\\nthe text of The Lord of the Rings was entered into word-\\nprocessing files. This next stage of textual evolution came\\nabouttoallowforagreateruniformityofthetextinallfuture\\neditions, but with it, inevitably, came new wrinkles. Some\",\"xvi note on the text\\nnewmisreadingsenteredintothetext,whileatthesametime\\nothers were fixed. In the worst instance, one line of the ring\\ninscription in the chapter ‘The Shadow of the Past’ of The\\nFellowship of the Ring was simply dropped. Unforeseeable\\nglitches arose in other editions when the base computerized\\ntext was transferred into page-making or typesetting pro-\\ngrams – e.g., in one edition of The Fellowship of the Ring, the\\nclosingtwosentencesof‘TheCouncilofElrond’simplyand\\ninexplicablydisappeared.Suchglitcheshavebeenverymuch\\nthe exception, not the rule, and the text has otherwise main-\\ntained a consistency and integrity throughout its com-\\nputerized evolution.\\nThe 1994 edition also contained a number of new correc-\\ntions(againsupervisedbyChristopherTolkien),aswellasa\\nreconfigured index of names and page references. The 1994\\ntextwasfirstusedinAmericaneditionspublishedbyHough-\\nton Mifflin in 1999. A small number of further corrections\\nwere added into the 2002 three-volume edition illustrated by\\nAlan Lee, published by HarperCollins in Great Britain and\\nHoughton Mifflin in the United States.\\nThe textual history of The Lord of the Rings, merely in its\\npublished form, is a vast and complex web. In this brief\\nnote I have given only a glimpse of the overall sequence and\\nstructure. Further details on the revisions and corrections\\nmade over the years to the published text of The Lord of the\\nRings, and a fuller account of its publishing history, may be\\nfoundinJ.R.R.Tolkien:ADescriptiveBibliography,byWayne\\nG.

Looking very closely at the hasty ink\\ndraft alongside the illustration, one can see underneath it the\\nearlier, hastier, pencilled draft. Also in The War of the Ring,\\nChristopher Tolkien reproduces a page from the first manu-\\nscript of the chapter ‘The Taming of Sme´agol’, and the\\nprinted text corresponding to this text is on the facing page\\n(see pp. 90–91).

Most notably in later years, Douglas A.\\nAnderson has been in the forefront of efforts to achieve an\\naccurate text of The Lord of the Rings (and of The Hobbit);\\nChristina Scull has published ‘A Preliminary Study of Vari-\\nations in Editions of The Lord of the Rings’ in Beyond Bree\\n(AprilandAugust1985);WayneG.Hammondhascompiled\\nextensivelistsoftextualchangesinJ.R.R.Tolkien:ADescrip-\\ntive Bibliography (1993); and David Bratman has published\\nanimportantarticle,‘ACorrigendatoTheLordoftheRings’,\\nin the March 1994 number of The Tolkien Collector. The\\nobservationsofDainisBisenieks,YuvalWelis,CharlesNoad,\\nand other readers, sent to us directly or posted in public\\nforums, have also been of service.\\nEfforts such as these follow the example of the author of\\nThe Lord of the Rings during his lifetime. His concern for the\\ntextual accuracy and coherence of his work is evident from\\nthe many emendations he made in later printings, and from\\nnotes he made for other emendations which for one reason\\noranotherhavenotpreviously(orhaveonlypartly)beenput\\ninto effect. Even late in life, when such labours wearied him,\\nhis feelings were clear. On 30 October 1967 he wrote to Joy\\nHill at George Allen & Unwin, concerning a reader’s query\\nhe had received about points in the Appendices to The Lord\\nof the Rings: ‘Personally I have ceased to bother about these\\nminor‘‘discrepancies’’,sinceifthegenealogiesandcalendars\\netc.lackverisimilitudeitisintheirgeneralexcessiveaccuracy:\",\"xxii note on the 50th anniversary edition\\nas compared with real annals or genealogies! Anyway the\\nslips were few, have now mostly been removed, and the dis-\\ncovery of what remain seems an amusing pastime! But errors\\nin the text are another matter’ (italics ours). In fact Tolkien\\nhad not ‘ceased to bother’, and ‘slips’ were dealt with as\\nopportunities arose. These, and the indulgence of his pub-\\nlisher, allowed Tolkien a luxury few authors enjoy: multiple\\nchances not only to correct his text but to improve it, and to\\nfurther develop the languages, geography, and peoples of\\nMiddle-earth.\\nThefiftiethanniversaryofTheLordoftheRingsseemedan\\nidealopportunitytoconsiderthelatest(2002)textinlightof\\ninformationwehadgatheredinthecourseofdecadesofwork\\nin Tolkien studies, with Steve Frisby’s research at hand, and\\nwith an electroniccopy of The Lord of theRings (supplied by\\nHarperCollins) searchable by keyword or phrase. The latter\\nespecially allowed us to develop lists of words that varied\\nfrom one instance to another, and investigate variations in\\nusage, as they stood in the copy-text and relative to earlier\\neditions and printings. Of course Tolkien wrote The Lord of\\nthe Rings over so long a period of time, some eighteen years,\\nthat inconsistencies in its text were almost inevitable. Chris-\\ntopher Tolkien even observed to us that some apparent\\ninconsistencies of form in his father’s work may even have\\nbeen deliberate: for instance, although Tolkien carefully dis-\\ntinguished house ‘dwelling’ from House ‘noble family or dyn-\\nasty’, in two instances he used house in the latter sense but\\nin lower case, perhaps because a capital letter would have\\ndetracted from the importance of the adjective with which\\nthe word was paired (‘royal house’, ‘golden house’). There\\ncanbenodoubt,however,thatTolkienattemptedtocorrect\\ninconsistency, no less than outright error, whenever it came\\nto his attention, and it was our opinion, with the advice and\\nagreementofChristopherTolkien,thatanattemptshouldbe\\nmadetodosointheanniversaryedition,insofaraswecould\\ncarefully and conservatively distinguish what to emend.\\nMany of the emendations in the present text are to marks\",\"note on the 50th anniversary edition xxiii\\nof punctuation, either to correct recent typographical errors\\nor to repair surviving alterations introduced in the second\\nprinting of The Fellowship of the Ring. In the latter respect\\nand in every case, Tolkien’s original punctuation is always\\nmore felicitous – subtle points, when one is comparing com-\\nmas and semi-colons, but no less a part of the author’s\\nintended expression. Distinctive words such as chill rather\\nthancold,andglisteredratherthanglistened,changedbytype-\\nsetters long ago without authorization, likewise have been\\nrestored. A controlled amount of regularization also seemed\\ncalled for, such as naught rather than nought, a change insti-\\ntuted by Tolkien but not carried through in all instances;\\nDark Power rather than dark power when the reference is\\nobviouslytoSauron(orMorgoth);Barrow-downsbyTolkien’s\\npreference rather than Barrowdowns; likewise Bree-hill rather\\nthan Bree Hill; accented and more common Dru´adan rather\\nthan Druadan; capitalized names of seasons when used as\\npersonificationormetaphor,accordingtoTolkien’spredomi-\\nnant practice and the internal logic of the text; and Elvish\\nratherthanelvishwhenusedasaseparateadjective,following\\napreferenceTolkienmarkedinhiscopyofthesecondedition\\nofTheLordoftheRings.Inaddition,wehaveaddedasecond\\naccent to Nu´meno´rean(s), as Tolkien often wrote the name in\\nmanuscript and as it appears in The Silmarillion and other\\nposthumous publications.\\nThe result, nonetheless, still includes many variations in\\ncapitalization, punctuation, and other points of style. Not all\\noftheseareerroneous:theyincludewordssuchasSun,Moon,\\nHobbit, and Man (or sun, moon, hobbit, man), which may\\nchangeformaccordingtomeaningorapplication,inrelation\\nto adjacent adjectives, or whether Tolkien intended personi-\\nfication, poetry, or emphasis. His intent cannot be divined\\nwith confidence in every case. But it is possible to discern\\nTolkien’spreferences inmany instances,from statementshe\\nwrote in his check copies of The Lord of the Rings or from a\\ncloseanalysisofitstextinmanuscript,typescript,proof,and\\nprint. Whenever there has been any doubt whatsoever as to\",\"xxiv note on the 50th anniversary edition\\nthe author’s intentions, the text has been allowed to stand.\\nMost of the demonstrable errors noted by Christopher\\nTolkien in The History of Middle-earth also have been cor-\\nrected, such as the distance from the Brandywine Bridge to\\nthe Ferry (ten miles rather than twenty) and the number of\\nMerry’s ponies (five rather than six), shadows of earlier\\ndrafts. But those inconsistencies of content, such as Gimli’s\\nfamous (and erroneous) statement in Book III, Chapter 7,\\n‘Till now I have hewn naught but wood since I left Moria’,\\nwhich would require rewriting to emend rather than simple\\ncorrection, remain unchanged.\\nSo many new emendations to The Lord of the Rings, and\\nsuchanextensivereviewofitstext,deservetobefullydocu-\\nmented.

It was begun soon\\nafter The Hobbit was written and before its publication in\\n1937; but I did not go on with this sequel, for I wished first\\nto complete and set in order the mythology and legends of\\nthe Elder Days, which had then been taking shape for some\\nyears. I desired to do this for my own satisfaction, and I had\\nlittlehopethatotherpeoplewouldbeinterestedinthiswork,\\nespecially since it was primarily linguistic in inspiration and\\nwas begun in order to provide the necessary background of\\n‘history’ for Elvish tongues.\\nWhen those whose advice and opinion I sought corrected\\nlittle hope to no hope, I went back to the sequel, encouraged\\nby requests from readers for more information concerning\\nhobbits and their adventures. But the story was drawn irre-\\nsistibly towards the older world, and became an account, as\\nit were, of its end and passing away before its beginning and\\nmiddle had been told. The process had begun in the writing\\nof The Hobbit, in which there were already some references\\nto the older matter: Elrond, Gondolin, the High-elves, and\\nthe orcs, as well as glimpses that had arisen unbidden of\\nthings higher or deeper or darker than its surface: Durin,\\nMoria, Gandalf, the Necromancer, the Ring. The discovery\\nof the significance of these glimpses and of their relation to\\nthe ancient histories revealed the Third Age and its culmi-\\nnation in the War of the Ring.\\nThose who had asked for more information about hobbits\\neventually got it, but they had to wait a long time; for the\\ncomposition of The Lord of the Rings went on at intervals\\nduringtheyears1936to1949,aperiodinwhichIhadmany\\nduties that I did not neglect, and many other interests as a\\nlearner and teacher that often absorbed me. The delay was,\",\"xxvi foreword to the second edition\\nof course, also increased by the outbreak of war in 1939, by\\ntheendofwhichyearthetalehadnotyetreachedtheendof\\nBook One. In spite of the darkness of the next five years I\\nfound that the story could not now be wholly abandoned,\\nandIploddedon,mostlybynight,tillIstoodbyBalin’stomb\\nin Moria. There I halted for a long while. It was almost a\\nyearlaterwhenI wentonandsocameto Lothlo´rienandthe\\nGreat River late in 1941. In the next year I wrote the first\\ndrafts of the matter that now stands as Book Three, and the\\nbeginnings of chapters I and III of Book Five; and there as\\nthebeaconsflaredinAno´rienandThe´odencametoHarrow-\\ndale I stopped. Foresight had failed and there was no time\\nfor thought.\\nItwasduring1944that,leavingthelooseendsandperplex-\\nities of a war which it was my task to conduct, or at least to\\nreport, I forced myself to tackle the journey of Frodo to\\nMordor. These chapters, eventually to become Book Four,\\nwere written and sent out as a serial to my son, Christopher,\\nthen in South Africa with the RAF. Nonetheless it took\\nanother five years before the tale was brought to its present\\nend; in that time I changed my house, my chair, and my\\ncollege,andthedaysthoughlessdarkwerenolesslaborious.\\nThenwhenthe‘end’hadatlastbeenreachedthewholestory\\nhad to be revised, and indeed largely re-written backwards.\\nAnd it had to be typed, and re-typed: by me; the cost of\\nprofessional typing by the ten-fingered was beyond my\\nmeans.\\nThe Lord of the Rings has been read by many people since\\nitfinallyappearedinprint;andIshouldliketosaysomething\\nhere with reference to the many opinions or guesses that I\\nhavereceivedorhavereadconcerningthemotivesandmean-\\ningofthetale.Theprimemotivewasthedesireofatale-teller\\nto try his hand at a really long story that would hold the\\nattention of readers, amuse them, delight them, and at times\\nmaybe excite them or deeply move them. As a guide I had\\nonly my own feelings for what is appealing or moving, and\\nfor many the guide was inevitably often at fault. Some who\",\"foreword to the second edition xxvii\\nhave read the book, or at any rate have reviewed it, have\\nfounditboring,absurd,orcontemptible;andIhavenocause\\nto complain, since I have similar opinions of their works, or\\nof the kinds of writing that they evidently prefer. But even\\nfrom the points of view of many who have enjoyed my story\\nthere is much that fails to please. It is perhaps not possible\\ninalongtaletopleaseeverybodyatallpoints,nortodisplease\\neverybody at the same points; for I find from the letters that\\nIhavereceivedthatthepassagesorchaptersthataretosome\\na blemish are all by others specially approved. The most\\ncritical reader of all, myself, now finds many defects, minor\\nand major, but being fortunately under no obligation either\\ntoreviewthebookortowriteitagain,hewillpassoverthese\\ninsilence,exceptonethathasbeennotedbyothers:thebook\\nis too short.\\nAs for any inner meaning or ‘message’, it has in the inten-\\ntion of the author none. It is neither allegorical nor topical.\\nAsthestorygrewitputdownroots(intothepast)andthrew\\nout unexpected branches: but its main theme was settled\\nfrom the outset by the inevitable choice of the Ring as the\\nlink between it and The Hobbit. The crucial chapter, ‘The\\nShadow of the Past’, is one of the oldest parts of the tale. It\\nwas written long before the foreshadow of 1939 had yet\\nbecome a threat of inevitable disaster, and from that point\\nthe story would have developed along essentially the same\\nlines, if that disaster had been averted. Its sources are things\\nlong before in mind, or in some cases already written, and\\nlittle or nothing in it was modified by the war that began in\\n1939 or its sequels.\\nThe real war does not resemble the legendary war in its\\nprocess or its conclusion. If it had inspired or directed the\\ndevelopment of the legend, then certainly the Ring would\\nhavebeenseizedandusedagainstSauron;hewouldnothave\\nbeenannihilatedbutenslaved,andBarad-duˆrwouldnothave\\nbeen destroyed but occupied. Saruman, failing to get pos-\\nsession of the Ring, would in the confusion and treacheries\\nof the time have found in Mordor the missing links in his\",\"xxviii foreword to the second edition\\nown researches into Ring-lore, and before long he would\\nhave made a Great Ring of his own with which to challenge\\nthe self-styled Ruler of Middle-earth. In that conflict both\\nsides would have held hobbits in hatred and contempt: they\\nwould not long have survived even as slaves.\\nOther arrangements could be devised according to the\\ntastesorviewsofthosewholikeallegoryortopicalreference.\\nBut I cordially dislike allegory in all its manifestations, and\\nalways have done so since I grew old and wary enough to\\ndetect its presence. I much prefer history, true or feigned,\\nwith its varied applicability to the thought and experience of\\nreaders. I think that many confuse ‘applicability’ with ‘alle-\\ngory’; but the one resides in the freedom of the reader, and\\nthe other in the purposed domination of the author.\\nAn author cannot of course remain wholly unaffected by\\nhis experience, but the ways in which a story-germ uses the\\nsoil of experience are extremely complex, and attempts to\\ndefine the process are at best guesses from evidence that is\\ninadequate and ambiguous. It is also false, though naturally\\nattractive, when the lives of an author and critic have over-\\nlapped, to suppose that the movements of thought or the\\nevents of times common to both were necessarily the most\\npowerful influences. One has indeed personally to come\\nunder the shadow of war to feel fully its oppression; but as\\ntheyearsgobyitseemsnowoftenforgottenthattobecaught\\nin youth by 1914 was no less hideous an experience than to\\nbe involved in 1939 and the following years. By 1918 all but\\none of my close friends were dead. Or totake a less grievous\\nmatter: it has been supposed by some that ‘The Scouring of\\nthe Shire’ reflects the situation in England at the time when\\nI was finishing my tale. It does not. It is an essential part of\\ntheplot,foreseenfromtheoutset,thoughintheeventmodi-\\nfied by the character of Saruman as developed in the story\\nwithout, need I say, any allegorical significance or contem-\\nporary political reference whatsoever. It has indeed some\\nbasis in experience, though slender (for the economic situ-\\nation was entirely different), and much further back.

Further information will also be found\\nin the selection from the Red Book of Westmarch that has\\nalready been published, under the title of The Hobbit. That\\nstory was derived from the earlier chapters of the Red Book,\\ncomposed by Bilbo himself, the first Hobbit to become\\nfamous in the world at large, and called by him There and\\nBack Again, since they told of his journey into the East and\\nhis return: an adventure which later involved all the Hobbits\\nin the great events of that Age that are here related.\\nMany, however, may wish to know more about this re-\\nmarkablepeoplefromtheoutset,whilesomemaynotpossess\\nthe earlier book. For such readers a few notes on the more\\nimportant points are here collected from Hobbit-lore, and\\nthe first adventure is briefly recalled.\\nHobbits are an unobtrusive but very ancient people, more\\nnumerous formerly than they are today; for they love peace\\nand quiet and good tilled earth: a well-ordered and well-\\nfarmed countryside was their favourite haunt. They do not\\nand did not understand or like machines more complicated\\nthan a forge-bellows, a water-mill, or a hand-loom, though\\nthey were skilful with tools. Even in ancient days they\\nwere, as a rule, shy of ‘the Big Folk’, as they call us, and\\nnow they avoid us with dismay and are becoming hard to\\nfind.

Their height is variable, ranging between two and\\nfour feet of our measure. They seldom now reach three feet;\\nbut they have dwindled, they say, and in ancient days they\\nwere taller.

But what exactly our relationship is can no longer\\nbe discovered. The beginning of Hobbits lies far back in the\\nElder Days that are now lost and forgotten. Only the Elves\\nstill preserve any records of that vanished time, and their\\ntraditions are concerned almost entirely with their own his-\\ntory,inwhichMenappearseldomandHobbitsarenotmen-\\ntioned at all. Yet it is clear that Hobbits had, in fact, lived\\nquietlyinMiddle-earthformanylongyearsbeforeotherfolk\\nbecame even aware of them. And the world being after all\\nfull of strange creatures beyond count, these little people\\nseemed of very little importance. But in the days of Bilbo,\\nand of Frodo his heir, they suddenly became, by no wish of\\ntheir own, both important and renowned, and troubled the\\ncounsels of the Wise and the Great.\\nThose days, the Third Age of Middle-earth, are now long\\npast, and the shape of all lands has been changed; but the\\nregionsin whichHobbits thenlived weredoubtlessthe same\\nas thosein whichthey stilllinger: theNorth-West ofthe Old\\nWorld, east of the Sea.

It is clear, nonetheless, from these\\nlegends, and from the evidence of their peculiar words and\\ncustoms,thatlikemanyotherfolkHobbitshadinthedistant\\npast moved westward. Their earliest tales seem to glimpse a\\ntime when they dwelt in the upper vales of Anduin, between\\ntheeavesofGreenwoodtheGreatandtheMistyMountains.\\nWhy they later undertook the hard and perilous crossing of\\nthe mountains into Eriador is no longer certain.

They\\nmoved westward early, and roamed over Eriador as far as\\nWeathertop while the others were still in Wilderland. They\\nwere the most normal and representative variety of Hobbit,\\nand far the most numerous.

These were specially favoured by\\nmillers, smiths, ropers, and cartwrights, and others of that\\nsort; for even when they had holes to live in, Hobbits had\\nlong been accustomed to build sheds and workshops.\\nThe habit of building farmhouses and barns was said to\\nhave begun among the inhabitants of the Marish down by\\nthe Brandywine.

The tallest\\nwasfurthestaway,standingaloneuponagreenmound.The\\nHobbits of the Westfarthing said that one could see the Sea\\nfrom the top of that tower; but no Hobbit had ever been\\nknown to climb it. Indeed, few Hobbits had ever seen or\\nsailed upon the Sea, and fewer still had ever returned to\\nreport it. Most Hobbits regarded even rivers and small boats\\nwith deep misgivings, and not many of them could swim.\\nAnd as the days of the Shire lengthened they spoke less and\\nless with the Elves, and grew afraid of them, and distrustful\\nof those that had dealings with them; and the Sea became a\\nword of fear among them, and a token of death, and they\\nturned their faces away from the hills in the west.\\nThe craft of building may have come from Elves or Men,\\nbut the Hobbits used it in their own fashion. They did not\\ngo in for towers. Their houses were usually long, low, and\\ncomfortable.

The best\",\"prologue 11\\nhome-grown still comes from that district, especially the\\nvarieties now known as Longbottom Leaf, Old Toby, and\\nSouthern Star.\\n‘How Old Toby came by the plant is not recorded, for to\\nhis dying day he would not tell. He knew much about herbs,\\nbut he was no traveller. It is said that in his youth he went\\noften to Bree, though he certainly never went further from\\nthe Shire than that. It is thus quite possible that he learned\\nofthisplantinBree,wherenow,atanyrate,itgrowswellon\\nthe south slopes of the hill. The Bree-hobbits claim to have\\nbeen the first actual smokers of the pipe-weed. They claim,\\nof course, to have done everything before the people of the\\nShire,whomtheyrefertoas‘‘colonists’’;butinthiscasetheir\\nclaim is, I think, likely to be true. And certainly it was from\\nBree that the art of smoking the genuine weed spread in\\nthe recent centuries among Dwarves and such other folk,\\nRangers, Wizards, or wanderers, as still passed to and fro\\nthrough that ancient road-meeting.

Nearly all Tooks still lived in the\\nTookland,butthatwasnottrueofmanyotherfamilies,such\\nas the Bagginses or the Boffins. Outside the Farthings were\\nthe East and West Marches: the Buckland (p. 129); and the\\nWestmarch added to the Shire in S.R. 1452.\\nThe Shire at this time had hardly any ‘government’.\\nFamiliesforthemostpartmanagedtheirownaffairs.Grow-\\ning food and eating it occupied most of their time. In\\nother matters they were, as a rule, generous and not greedy,\\nbut contented and moderate, so that estates, farms, work-\\nshops, and small trades tended to remain unchanged for\\ngenerations.\\nThere remained, of course, the ancient tradition concern-\\ning the high king at Fornost, or Norbury as they called it,\\nawaynorthoftheShire.Buttherehadbeennokingfornearly\\nathousandyears,andeventheruinsofKings’Norburywere\\ncoveredwithgrass.YettheHobbitsstillsaidofwildfolkand\\nwicked things (such as trolls) that they had not heard of the\\nking.

The Thain was the master of the Shire-\\nmoot, and captain of the Shire-muster and the Hobbitry-in-\\narms; but as muster and moot were only held in times of\\nemergency, which no longer occurred, the Thainship had\\nceased to be more than a nominal dignity. The Took family\",\"prologue 13\\nwas still, indeed, accorded a special respect, for it remained\\nboth numerous and exceedingly wealthy, and was liable to\\nproduce in every generation strong characters of peculiar\\nhabits and even adventurous temperament. The latter quali-\\nties, however, were now rather tolerated (in the rich) than\\ngenerally approved. The custom endured, nonetheless, of\\nreferring to the head of the family as The Took, and of\\nadding to his name, if required, a number: such as Isengrim\\nthe Second, for instance.\\nTheonlyrealofficialintheShireatthisdatewastheMayor\\nof Michel Delving (or of the Shire), who was elected every\\nsevenyearsattheFreeFairontheWhiteDownsattheLithe,\\nthat is at Midsummer.

But the offices of Postmaster\\nand First Shirriff were attached to the mayoralty, so that he\\nmanaged both the Messenger Service and the Watch. These\\nwere the only Shire-services, and the Messengers were the\\nmost numerous, and much the busier of the two. By no\\nmeans all Hobbits were lettered, but those who were wrote\\nconstantly to all their friends (and a selection of their\\nrelations) who lived further off than an afternoon’s walk.\\nThe Shirriffs was the name that the Hobbits gave to their\\npolice, or the nearest equivalent that they possessed.

The\\nquestwassuccessful,andtheDragonthatguardedthehoard\\nwas destroyed. Yet, though before all was won the Battle of\\nFive Armies was fought, and Thorin was slain, and many\\ndeeds of renown were done, the matter would scarcely have\\nconcerned later history, or earned more than a note in\\nthelongannalsoftheThirdAge,butforan‘accident’bythe\\nway. The party was assailed by Orcs in a high pass of the\\nMistyMountainsastheywenttowardsWilderland;andsoit\\nhappened that Bilbo was lost for a while in the black orc-\\nmines deep under the mountains, and there, as he groped in\\nvaininthe dark,heputhis handonaring,lying onthefloor\\nof a tunnel. He put it in his pocket. It seemed then like mere\\nluck.\\nTrying to find his way out, Bilbo went on down to the\\nroots of the mountains, until he could go no further. At the\",\"prologue 15\\nbottom of the tunnel lay a cold lake far from the light, and\\non an island of rock in the water lived Gollum. He was a\\nloathsome little creature: he paddled a small boat with his\\nlarge flat feet, peering with pale luminous eyes and catching\\nblind fish with his long fingers, and eating them raw. He ate\\nany living thing, even orc, if he could catch it and strangle it\\nwithout a struggle. He possessed a secret treasure that had\\ncome to him long ages ago, when he still lived in the light: a\\nring of gold that made its wearer invisible. It was the one\\nthing he loved, his ‘Precious’, and he talked to it, even when\\nit was not with him. For he kept it hidden safe in a hole on\\nhisisland,exceptwhenhewashuntingorspyingontheorcs\\nof the mines.\\nMaybe he would have attacked Bilbo at once, if the ring\\nhad been on him when they met; but it was not, and the\\nhobbit held in his hand an Elvish knife, which served him as\\na sword. So to gain time Gollum challenged Bilbo to the\\nRiddle-game, saying that if he asked a riddle which Bilbo\\ncould not guess, then he would kill him and eat him; but if\\nBilbo defeated him, then he would do as Bilbo wished: he\\nwould lead him to a way out of the tunnels.\\nSince he was lost in the dark without hope, and could\\nneither go on nor back, Bilbo accepted the challenge; and\\nthey asked one another many riddles. In the end Bilbo won\\nthe game, more by luck (as it seemed) than by wits; for he\\nwas stumped at last for a riddle to ask, and cried out, as his\\nhand came upon the ring he had picked up and forgotten:\\nWhat have I got in my pocket? This Gollum failed to answer,\\nthough he demanded three guesses.\\nTheAuthorities, itis true,differ whetherthislast question\\nwasamere‘question’andnota‘riddle’accordingtothestrict\\nrules of the Game; but all agree that, after accepting it and\\ntrying to guess the answer, Gollum was bound by his\\npromise. And Bilbo pressed him to keep his word; for the\\nthought came to him that this slimy creature might prove\\nfalse, even though such promises were held sacred, and of\\nold all but the wickedest things feared to break them. But\",\"16 prologue\\nafter ages alone in the dark Gollum’s heart was black, and\\ntreachery was in it. He slipped away, and returned to his\\nisland, of which Bilbo knew nothing, not far off in the dark\\nwater. There, he thought, lay his ring. He was hungry now,\\nand angry, and once his ‘Precious’ was with him he would\\nnot fear any weapon at all.\\nBut the ring was not on the island; he had lost it, it was\\ngone.HisscreechsentashiverdownBilbo’sback,thoughhe\\ndidnotyetunderstandwhathadhappened.ButGollumhad\\nat last leaped to a guess, too late.

So it was that\\nGollum passed him without seeing him, and went to guard\\nthe way out, lest the ‘thief’ should escape.

To them his account was that\\nGollum had promised to give him a present, if he won the\",\"prologue 17\\ngame; but when Gollum went to fetch it from his island he\\nfound the treasure was gone: a magic ring, which had been\\ngiventohimlongagoonhisbirthday.Bilboguessedthatthis\\nwas the very ring that he had found, and as he had won the\\ngame, it was already his by right.

Evidently it\\nstill appeared in the original Red Book, as it did in several of\\nthe copies and abstracts. But many copies contain the true\\naccount (as an alternative), derived no doubt from notes by\\nFrodo or Samwise, both of whom learned the truth, though\\nthey seem to have been unwilling to delete anything actually\\nwritten by the old hobbit himself.\\nGandalf, however, disbelieved Bilbo’s first story, as soon\\nasheheardit,andhecontinuedtobeverycuriousaboutthe\\nring. Eventually he got the true tale out of Bilbo after much\\nquestioning, which for a while strained their friendship; but\\nthe wizard seemed to think the truth important. Though he\\ndid not say so to Bilbo, he also thought it important, and\\ndisturbing, to find that the good hobbit had not told the\\ntruthfromthefirst:quitecontrarytohishabit.Theideaofa\\n‘present’ was not mere hobbitlike invention, all the same. It\\nwas suggested to Bilbo, as he confessed, by Gollum’s talk\\nthat he overheard; for Gollum did, in fact, call the ring his\\n‘birthday-present’, many times. That also Gandalf thought\\nstrange and suspicious; but he did not discover the truth\\nin this point for many more years, as will be seen in this\\nbook.\\nOf Bilbo’s later adventures little more need be said here.\\nWith the help of the ring he escaped from the orc-guards at\\nthegateandrejoinedhiscompanions.Heusedtheringmany\\ntimes on his quest, chiefly for the help of his friends; but he\\nkept it secret from them as long as he could.

Each year the Bagginses had\\ngiven very lively combined birthday-parties at Bag End; but\\nnow it was understood that something quite exceptional\\nwas being planned for that autumn. Bilbo was going to be\\neleventy-one, 111, a rather curious number, and a very re-\\nspectable age for a hobbit (the Old Took himself had only\\nreached 130); and Frodo was going to be thirty-three, 33, an\\nimportant number: the date of his ‘coming of age’.\\nTongues began to wag in Hobbiton and Bywater; and\\nrumour of the coming event travelled all over the Shire. The\\nhistory and character of Mr. Bilbo Baggins became once\\nagain the chief topic of conversation; and the older folk\\nsuddenly found their reminiscences in welcome demand.\\nNo one had a more attentive audience than old Ham\\nGamgee, commonly known as the Gaffer.

It\\nwasdrivenbyoutlandishfolk,singingstrangesongs:dwarves\\nwith long beards and deep hoods. A few of them remained\\nat Bag End. At the end of the second week in September a\\ncart came in through Bywater from the direction of Brandy-\\nwine Bridge in broad daylight. An old man was driving it all\\nalone.Heworeatallpointedbluehat,alonggreycloak,and\\nasilverscarf.Hehadalongwhitebeardandbushyeyebrows\\nthat stuck out beyond the brim of his hat. Small hobbit-\\nchildren ran after the cart all through Hobbiton and right up\\nthe hill. It had a cargo of fireworks, as they rightly guessed.\\nAt Bilbo’s front door the old man began to unload: there\\nwere great bundles of fireworks of all sorts and shapes, each\\nlabelled with a large red G and the elf-rune, .\\nThat was Gandalf’s mark, of course, and the old man\\nwas Gandalf the Wizard, whose fame in the Shire was due\\nmainly to his skill with fires, smokes, and lights. His real\\nbusiness was far more difficult and dangerous, but the\\nShire-folk knew nothing about it. To them he was just one\\nof the ‘attractions’ at the Party. Hence the excitement of\\nthe hobbit-children. ‘G for Grand!’ they shouted, and the\\nold man smiled. They knew him by sight, though he only\\nappeared in Hobbiton occasionally and never stopped long;\\nbut neither they nor any but the oldest of their elders had\\nseen one of his firework displays – they now belonged to a\\nlegendary past.\\nWhen the old man, helped by Bilbo and some dwarves,\\nhad finished unloading, Bilbo gave a few pennies away; but\",\"a long-expected party 33\\nnot a single squib or cracker was forthcoming, to the dis-\\nappointment of the onlookers.\\n‘Run away now!’ said Gandalf. ‘You will get plenty when\\nthetimecomes.’ThenhedisappearedinsidewithBilbo,and\\nthe door was shut.

The flowers\\nglowed red and golden: snap-dragons and sunflowers, and\\nnasturtians trailing all over the turf walls and peeping in at\\nthe round windows.\\n‘How bright your garden looks!’ said Gandalf.\\n‘Yes,’ said Bilbo. ‘I am very fond indeed of it, and of all\\nthe dear old Shire; but I think I need a holiday.’\\n‘You mean to go on with your plan then?’\\n‘I do. I made up my mind months ago, and I haven’t\\nchanged it.’\\n‘Very well. It is no good saying any more. Stick to your\\nplan – your whole plan, mind – and I hope it will turn out\\nfor the best, for you, and for all of us.’\\n‘I hope so.

There was a constant stream of them going\\nup the Hill, carrying hundreds of polite variations on Thank\\nyou, I shall certainly come.\\nA notice appeared on the gate at Bag End: no admit-\\ntance except on party business. Even those who had,\\nor pretended to have Party Business were seldom allowed\\ninside.

There was a specially large\\npavilion, so big that the tree that grew in the field was right\\ninside it, and stood proudly near one end, at the head of\\nthe chief table. Lanterns were hung on all its branches.\\nMore promising still (to the hobbits’ mind): an enormous\\nopen-air kitchen was erected in the north corner of the field.\\nA draught of cooks, from every inn and eating-house for\\nmiles around, arrived to supplement the dwarves and other\\nodd folk that were quartered at Bag End. Excitement rose to\\nits height.\\nThen the weather clouded over. That was on Wednesday\\nthe eve of the Party. Anxiety was intense. Then Thursday,\\nSeptember the 22nd, actually dawned. The sun got up, the\\nclouds vanished, flags were unfurled and the fun began.\\nBilbo Baggins called it a party, but it was really a variety\\nofentertainmentsrolledintoone.Practicallyeverybodyliving\\nnear was invited.

Bilbo met\\nthe guests (and additions) at the new white gate in person.\\nHe gave away presents to all and sundry – the latter were\\nthose who went out again by a back way and came in again\\nby the gate. Hobbits give presents to other people on their\\nown birthdays. Not very expensive ones, as a rule, and not\\nso lavishly as on this occasion; but it was not a bad system.\\nActually in Hobbiton and Bywater every day in the year was\\nsomebody’s birthday, so that every hobbit in those parts had\\na fairchance of at leastone present atleast once a week.But\\nthey never got tired of them.\\nOn this occasion the presents were unusually good. The\\nhobbit-children were so excited that for a while they almost\\nforgot about eating. There were toys the like of which they\\nhadneverseenbefore,allbeautifulandsomeobviouslymagi-\\ncal.

They all ducked,\\nand many fell flat on their faces. The dragon passed like an\\nexpress train, turned a somersault, and burst over Bywater\\nwith a deafening explosion.\\n‘That is the signal for supper!’ said Bilbo. The pain and\\nalarm vanished at once, and the prostrate hobbits leaped to\\ntheir feet. There was a splendid supper for everyone; for\\neveryone, that is, except those invited to the special family\\ndinner-party. This was held in the great pavilion with the\\ntree.Theinvitationswerelimitedtotwelvedozen(anumber\\nalso called by the hobbits one Gross, though the word was\\nnotconsideredpropertouseofpeople);andtheguestswere\\nselected from all the families to which Bilbo and Frodo were\\nrelated, with the addition of a few special unrelated friends\\n(such as Gandalf).

Some of these were only very\\ndistantly connected with Bilbo, and some had hardly ever\\nbeen in Hobbiton before, as they lived in remote corners of\\nthe Shire. The Sackville-Bagginses were not forgotten. Otho\\nand his wife Lobelia were present. They disliked Bilbo and\\ndetested Frodo, but so magnificent was the invitation card,\\nwritten in golden ink, that they had felt it was impossible to\\nrefuse.

I should\\nsay: OUR birthday. For it is, of course, also the birthday of my\\nheirandnephew,Frodo.Hecomesofageandintohisinheritance\\ntoday. Some perfunctory clapping by the elders; and some\\nloud shouts of ‘Frodo! Frodo! Jolly old Frodo,’ from the\\njuniors. The Sackville-Bagginses scowled, and wondered\\nwhat was meant by ‘coming into his inheritance’.\\nTogether we score one hundred and forty-four.

Of all the legends that he had heard in his\\nearly years such fragments of tales and half-remembered\\nstoriesabouttheElvesasthehobbitsknew,hadalwaysmoved\\nhim most deeply. ‘There are some, even in these parts, as\\nknow the Fair Folk and get news of them,’ he said. ‘There’s\\nMr. Baggins now,that I work for.He told me thatthey were\\nsailingandheknowsabitaboutElves.AndoldMr.Bilboknew\\nmore:many’s the talk I had with him when I was a little lad.’\\n‘Oh,they’rebothcracked,’saidTed.‘LeastwaysoldBilbo\\nwas cracked, and Frodo’s cracking.

For one thing, there was a lot to do up in the\\nBag End garden, and he would have a busy day tomorrow,\\nif the weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But Sam\\nhad more on his mind than gardening.

But that evening, as Sam was walking\\nhome and twilight was fading, there came the once familiar\\ntap on the study window.\\nFrodo welcomed his old friend with surprise and great\\ndelight. They looked hard at one another.\\n‘All well eh?’ said Gandalf. ‘You look the same as ever,\\nFrodo!’\\n‘So do you,’ Frodo replied; but secretly he thought that\\nGandalf looked older and more careworn. He pressed him\\nfor news of himself and of the wide world, and soon they\\nwere deep in talk, and they stayed up far into the night.\\nNext morning after a late breakfast, the wizard was sitting\\nwith Frodo by the open window of the study. A bright fire\",\"the shadow of the past 61\\nwas on the hearth, but the sun was warm, and the wind was\\nin the South. Everything looked fresh, and the new green of\\nspring was shimmering in the fields and on the tips of the\\ntrees’ fingers.\\nGandalf was thinking of a spring, nearly eighty years\\nbefore, when Bilbo had run out of Bag End without a hand-\\nkerchief. His hair was perhaps whiter than it had been then,\\nand his beard and eyebrows were perhaps longer, and his\\nface more lined with care and wisdom; but his eyes were as\\nbrightasever,andhesmokedandblewsmoke-ringswiththe\\nsame vigour and delight.\\nHe was smokingnow in silence, for Frodo wassitting still,\\ndeepinthought.Eveninthelightofmorninghefeltthedark\\nshadow of the tidings that Gandalf had brought.

There was another long\\nsilence. The sound of Sam Gamgee cutting the lawn came\\nin from the garden.\\n‘How long have you known this?’ asked Frodo at length.\\n‘And how much did Bilbo know?’\\n‘Bilbo knew no more than he told you, I am sure,’ said\\nGandalf. ‘He would certainly never have passed on to you\\nanything that he thought would be a danger, even though I\\npromised to look after you. He thought the ring was very\\nbeautiful,andveryusefulatneed;andifanythingwaswrong\\nor queer, it was himself. He said that it was ‘‘growing on his\\nmind’’, and he was always worrying about it; but he did not\\nsuspect that the ring itself was to blame. Though he had\\nfoundoutthatthethingneededlookingafter;itdidnotseem\\nalways of the same size or weight; it shrank or expanded in\\nan odd way, and might suddenly slip off a finger where it\\nhad been tight.’\\n‘Yes, he warned me of that in his last letter,’ said Frodo,\\n‘so I have always kept it on its chain.’\\n‘Very wise,’ said Gandalf. ‘But as for his long life, Bilbo\\nnever connected it with the ring at all. He took all the credit\\nfor that to himself, and he was very proud of it. Though he\\nwas getting restless and uneasy. Thin and stretched he said.\\nA sign that the ring was getting control.’\\n‘How long have you known all this?’ asked Frodo again.\\n‘Known?’ said Gandalf. ‘I haveknown much that only the\\nWiseknow,Frodo.Butifyoumean‘‘knownaboutthisring’’,\\nwell, I still do not know, one might say. There is a last test to\\nmake. But I no longer doubt my guess.\\n‘WhendidIfirstbegintoguess?’hemused,searchingback\\nin memory. ‘Let me see – it was in the year that the White\\nCouncil drove the Dark Power from Mirkwood, just before\\ntheBattleofFiveArmies,thatBilbofoundhisring.Ashadow\",\"the shadow of the past 63\\nfell on my heart then, though I did not know yet what I\\nfeared.IwonderedoftenhowGollumcamebyaGreatRing,\\nas plainly it was – that at least was clear from the first.

I could not take it from\\nhim without doing greater harm; and I had no right to do so\\nanyway. I could only watch and wait. I might perhaps have\\nconsulted Saruman the White, but something always held\\nme back.’\\n‘Who is he?’ asked Frodo. ‘I have never heard of him\\nbefore.’\\n‘Maybe not,’ answered Gandalf. ‘Hobbits are, or were, no\\nconcern of his.

There was among them a family of high repute, for it\\nwas large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a\\ngrandmother of the folk, stern and wise in old lore, such as\\nthey had. The most inquisitive and curious-minded of that\\nfamily was called Sme´agol. He was interested in roots and\\nbeginnings; he dived into deep pools; he burrowed under\\ntrees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds;\\nand he ceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on\\ntrees, or the flowers opening in the air: his head and his eyes\\nwere downward.\\n‘He had a friend called De´agol, of similar sort, sharper-\\neyedbutnotsoquickandstrong.Onatimetheytookaboat\\nandwentdowntotheGladdenFields,wherethereweregreat\\nbeds of iris and flowering reeds.

He became sharp-eyed and\\nkeen-eared for all that was hurtful. The ring had given him\\npower according to his stature. It is not to be wondered at\\nthat he became very unpopular and was shunned (when vis-\\nible) by all his relations. They kicked him, and he bit their\\nfeet. He took to thieving, and going about muttering to him-\\nself, and gurgling in his throat.

The decision to set\\nout eastwards had suggested the idea to him; for Buckland\\nwas on the eastern borders of the Shire, and as he had lived\\nthere in childhood his going back would at least seem\\ncredible.\\nGandalfstayedintheShireforovertwomonths.Thenone\\nevening,attheendofJune,soonafterFrodo’splanhadbeen\",\"88 the fellowship of the ring\\nfinally arranged, he suddenly announced that he was going\\noff again next morning. ‘Only for a short while, I hope,’ he\\nsaid. ‘But I am going down beyond the southern borders to\\ngetsomenews,ifIcan.IhavebeenidlelongerthanIshould.’\\nHe spoke lightly, but it seemed to Frodo that he looked\\nrather worried. ‘Has anything happened?’ he asked.\\n‘Well no; but I have heard something that has made me\\nanxious and needs looking into.

The Shire had seldom seen so fair a summer, or so\\nrich an autumn: the trees were laden with apples, honey was\\ndripping in the combs, and the corn was tall and full.\\nAutumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry\\nabout Gandalf again. September was passing and there was\\nstill no news of him. The Birthday, and the removal, drew\\nnearer, and still he did not come, or send word. Bag End\\nbegan to be busy. Some of Frodo’s friends came to stay and\\nhelp him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and\\nFolco Boffin, and of course his special friends Pippin Took\\nandMerryBrandybuck.Betweenthemtheyturnedthewhole\\nplace upside-down.\\nOn September 20th two covered carts went off laden to\\nBuckland,conveyingthefurnitureandgoodsthatFrodohad\\nnot sold to his new home, by way of the Brandywine\\nBridge.The next day Frodo became really anxious, and kept\\na constant look-out for Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday\\nmorning, dawned as fair and clear as it had long ago for\\nBilbo’s great party. Still Gandalf did not appear. In the\",\"three is company 89\\nevening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was quite small, just\\nadinnerforhimselfandhisfourhelpers;buthewastroubled\\nand felt in no mood for it.

The dining-room was bare except for a table and\\nchairs, but the food was good, and there was good wine:\\nFrodo’s wine had not been included in the sale to the\\nSackville-Bagginses.\\n‘Whateverhappenstotherestofmystuff,whentheS.-B.s\\nget their claws on it, at any rate I have found a good home\\nfor this!’ said Frodo, as he drained his glass. It was the last\\ndrop of Old Winyards.\\nWhen they had sung many songs, and talked of many\\nthings they had done together, they toasted Bilbo’s birthday,\\nand they drank his health and Frodo’s together according to\\nFrodo’s custom.

He had\\nnot done any strenuous walking for a long time, and the\\nreflection looked rather flabby, he thought.\\nAfter lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her\\nsandy-hairedson,Lotho,turnedup,muchtoFrodo’sannoy-\\nance.‘Oursatlast!’saidLobelia,asshesteppedinside.Itwas\\nnot polite; nor strictly true, for the sale of Bag End did not\\ntake effect until midnight.

She snorted, and showed plainly that she\\nthought the Gamgees capable of plundering the hole during\\nthe night. Frodo did not offer her any tea.\\nHe took his own tea with Pippin and Sam Gamgee in the\\nkitchen. It had been officially announced that Sam was\\ncoming to Buckland ‘to do for Mr. Frodo and look after his\\nbit of garden’; an arrangement that was approved by the\\nGaffer, though it did not console him for the prospect of\\nhaving Lobelia as a neighbour.\\n‘Our last meal at Bag End!’ said Frodo, pushing back his\\nchair. They leftthe washing up for Lobelia. Pippinand Sam\\nstrapped up their three packs and piled them in the porch.\\nPippin went out for a last stroll in the garden. Sam dis-\\nappeared.\\nThesunwentdown.BagEndseemedsadandgloomyand\\ndishevelled. Frodo wandered round the familiar rooms, and\\nsaw the light of the sunset fade on the walls, and shadows\\ncreep out of the corners. It grew slowly dark indoors. He\\nwent out and walked down to the gate at the bottom of the\\npath, and then on a short way down the Hill Road. He half\",\"three is company 91\\nexpected to see Gandalf come striding up through the dusk.\\nThe sky was clear and the stars were growing bright. ‘It’s\\ngoing to be a fine night,’ he said aloud. ‘That’s good for a\\nbeginning.

I am going to start, and Gandalf must follow me.’ He\\nturnedtogoback,andthenstopped,forheheardvoices,just\\nroundthecornerbytheendofBagshotRow.Onevoicewas\\ncertainly the old Gaffer’s; the other was strange, and some-\\nhow unpleasant. He could not make out what it said, but he\\nheardtheGaffer’sanswers,whichwererathershrill.Theold\\nman seemed put out.\\n‘No, Mr. Baggins has gone away.

Frodo wondered\\nvaguely why the fact that they did not come on up the Hill\\nseemed a great relief. ‘I am sick of questions and curiosity\\naboutmydoings,Isuppose,’hethought.‘Whataninquisitive\\nlot they all are!’ He had half a mind to go and ask the Gaffer\\nwho the inquirer was; but he thought better (or worse) of it,\\nand turned and walked quickly back to Bag End.\\nPippin was sitting on his pack in the porch. Sam was not\\nthere. Frodo stepped inside the dark door. ‘Sam!’ he called.\\n‘Sam! Time!’\\n‘Coming, sir!’ came the answer from far within, followed\\nsoonbySamhimself,wipinghismouth.Hehadbeensaying\\nfarewell to the beer-barrel in the cellar.\\n‘All aboard, Sam?’ said Frodo.\\n‘Yes, sir. I’ll last for a bit now, sir.’\\nFrodo shut and locked the round door, and gave the key\\nto Sam. ‘Run down with this to your home, Sam!’ he said.\\n‘Then cut along the Row and meet us as quick as you can at\",\"92 the fellowship of the ring\\nthe gate in the lane beyond the meadows. We are not going\\nthroughthevillagetonight.Toomanyearsprickingandeyes\\nprying.’ Sam ran off at full speed.\\n‘Well, now we’re off at last!’ said Frodo. They shouldered\\ntheir packs and took up their sticks, and walked round the\\ncorner to the west side of Bag End. ‘Good-bye!’ said Frodo,\\nlooking at the dark blank windows. He waved his hand, and\\nthenturnedand(followingBilbo,ifhehadknownit)hurried\\nafter Peregrin down the garden-path. They jumped over the\\nlow place in the hedge at the bottom and took to the fields,\\npassing into the darkness like a rustle in the grasses.\\nAt the bottom of the Hill on its western side they came to\\nthe gate opening on to a narrow lane. There they halted and\\nadjusted the straps of their packs. Presently Sam appeared,\\ntrotting quickly and breathing hard; his heavy pack was\\nhoisted high on his shoulders, and he had put on his head a\\ntall shapeless felt bag, which he called a hat. In the gloom he\\nlooked very much like a dwarf.\\n‘I am sure you have given me all the heaviest stuff,’ said\\nFrodo. ‘I pity snails, and all that carry their homes on their\\nbacks.’\\n‘I could take a lot more yet, sir. My packet is quite light,’\\nsaid Sam stoutly and untruthfully.\\n‘Noyoudon’t,Sam!’saidPippin.‘Itisgoodforhim.He’s\\ngot nothing except what he ordered us to pack. He’s been\\nslack lately, and he’ll feel the weight less when he’s walked\\noff some of his own.’\\n‘Be kind to a poor old hobbit!’ laughed Frodo. ‘I shall be\\nas thin as a willow-wand, I’m sure, before I get to Buckland.\\nBut I was talking nonsense. I suspect you have taken more\\nthan your share, Sam, and I shall look into it at our next\\npacking.’ He picked up his stick again. ‘Well, we all like\\nwalking in the dark,’ he said, ‘so let’s put some miles behind\\nus before bed.’\\nFor a short way they followed the lane westwards.

As they began to climb its first slopes they looked\\nback and saw the lamps in Hobbiton far off twinkling in the\\ngentle valley of the Water.

Thin-clad birches, swaying in a light wind\\nabove their heads, made a black net against the pale sky.\\nThey ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits), and then went\\non again.

It\\nwas very dark.

At\\nlast, as they began to climb a steep slope, he stopped and\\nyawned.\\n‘I am so sleepy,’ he said, ‘that soon I shall fall down on\\nthe road. Are you going to sleep on your legs? It is nearly\\nmidnight.’\\n‘I thought you liked walking in the dark,’ said Frodo. ‘But\\nthere is no great hurry.

Then, each in an angle of the great\\ntree’s roots, they curled up in their cloaks and blankets, and\\nwere soon fast asleep. They set no watch; even Frodo feared\\nno danger yet, for they were still in the heart of the Shire. A\\nfew creatures came and looked at them when the fire had\\ndied away. A fox passing through the wood on business of\\nhis own stopped several minutes and sniffed.\\n‘Hobbits!’ he thought. ‘Well, what next? I have heard of\\nstrange doings in this land, but I have seldom heard of a\\nhobbit sleeping out of doors under a tree.

Then\\nthe sun gleamed out of ragged clouds again and the rain\\nlessened. It was now past mid-day, and they felt it was high\\ntime for lunch. They halted under an elm tree: its leaves\\nthough fast turning yellow were still thick, and the ground at\\nitsfeetwasfairlydryandsheltered.Whentheycametomake\\ntheir meal, they found that the Elves had filled their bottles\\nwith a clear drink, pale golden in colour: it had the scent of\\nahoneymadeofmanyflowers,andwaswonderfullyrefresh-\\ning.Verysoontheywerelaughing,andsnappingtheirfingers\\nat rain, and at Black Riders. The last few miles, they felt,\\nwould soon be behind them.\",\"118 the fellowship of the ring\\nFrodo propped his back against the tree-trunk, and closed\\nhis eyes. Sam and Pippin sat near, and they began to hum,\\nand then to sing softly:\\nHo! Ho!

Ho! Ho! they began again louder. They stopped short\\nsuddenly. Frodo sprang to his feet. A long-drawn wail came\\ndown the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature.\\nIt rose and fell, and ended on a high piercing note. Even as\\nthey sat and stood, as if suddenly frozen, it was answered by\\nanothercry,fainterandfurtheroff,butnolesschillingtothe\\nblood. There was then a silence, broken only by the sound\\nof the wind in the leaves.\\n‘And what do you think that was?’ Pippin asked at last,\\ntryingtospeaklightly, butquaveringalittle.‘Ifit wasabird,\\nit was one that I never heard in the Shire before.’\\n‘It was not bird or beast,’ said Frodo. ‘It was a call, or a\\nsignal – there were words in that cry, though I could not\\ncatch them. But no hobbit has such a voice.’\\nNo more was said about it. They were all thinking of the\\nRiders, but no one spoke of them. They were now reluctant\\neithertostayorgoon;butsoonerorlatertheyhadgottoget\\nacross the open country to the Ferry, and it was best to go\\nsooner and in daylight.

The others looked at him in\\nsurprise.\\n‘What’s wrong with old Maggot?’ asked Pippin. ‘He’s a\\ngood friend to all the Brandybucks. Of course he’s a terror\\nto trespassers, and keeps ferocious dogs – but after all, folk\\ndown here are near the border and have to be more on their\\nguard.’\\n‘I know,’ said Frodo. ‘But all the same,’ he added with a\\nshamefacedlaugh,‘Iamterrifiedofhimandhisdogs.Ihave\\navoided his farm for years and years.

The black fellow sat quite still.\\n‘‘‘I come from yonder,’’ he said, slow and stiff-like,\\npointing back west, over my fields, if you please. ‘‘Have you\\nseen Baggins?’’ he asked in a queer voice, and bent down\\ntowards me.

Thesun was already behind the western\\nhills,andthelightwasfailing.TwoofMaggot’ssonsandhis\\nthree daughters came in, and a generous supper was laid on\\nthe large table. The kitchen was lit with candles and the fire\\nwas mended. Mrs. Maggot bustled in and out. One or two\\nother hobbits belonging to the farm-household came in. In a\\nshort while fourteen sat down to eat. There was beer in\\nplenty, and a mighty dish of mushrooms and bacon, besides\\nmuch other solid farmhouse fare. The dogs lay by the fire\\nand gnawed rinds and cracked bones.\\nWhen they had finished, the farmer and his sons went out\\nwith a lantern and got the waggon ready.

There was now\\nno breath of wind stirring; the night was still and quiet, and\\na chill was in the air. They went without lights and took it\\nslowly. After a mile or two the lane came to an end, crossing\\na deep dike, and climbing a short slope up on to the high-\\nbanked causeway.\\nMaggot got down and took a good look either way, north\\nand south, but nothing could be seen in the darkness, and\\ntherewasnotasoundinthestillair.Thinstrandsofriver-mist\\nwere hanging above the dikes, and crawling over the fields.\\n‘It’s going to be thick,’ said Maggot; ‘but I’ll not light my\\nlanterns till I turn for home.

His family grew and grew, and after his days con-\",\"a conspiracy unmasked 129\\ntinued to grow, until Brandy Hall occupied the whole of the\\nlow hill, and had three large front-doors, many side-doors,\\nand about a hundred windows. The Brandybucks and their\\nnumerous dependants then began to burrow, and later to\\nbuild, all round about. That was the origin of Buckland, a\\nthicklyinhabitedstripbetweentheriverandtheOldForest,a\\nsortofcolonyfromtheShire.ItschiefvillagewasBucklebury,\\nclustering in the banks and slopes behind Brandy Hall.\\nThe people in the Marish were friendly with the Buck-\\nlanders, and the authority of the Master of the Hall (as the\\nheadoftheBrandybuckfamilywascalled)wasstillacknowl-\\nedged by the farmers between Stock and Rushey. But most\\nof the folk of the old Shire regarded the Bucklanders as\\npeculiar, half foreigners as it were. Though, as a matter of\\nfact, they were not very different from the other hobbits\\nof the Four Farthings. Except in one point: they were fond\\nof boats, and some of them could swim.\\nTheir land was originally unprotected from the East; but\\non that side they had built a hedge: the High Hay. It had\\nbeen planted many generations ago, and was now thick and\\ntall, for it was constantly tended. It ran all the way from\\nBrandywine Bridge, in a big loop curving away from the\\nriver, to Haysend (where the Withywindle flowed out of the\\nForestintotheBrandywine):wellovertwentymilesfromend\\nto end. But, of course, it was not a complete protection.\\nThe Forest drew close to the hedge in many places. The\\nBucklanders kept their doors locked after dark, and that also\\nwas not usual in the Shire.\\nThe ferry-boat moved slowly across the water. The Buck-\\nland shore drew nearer.

Do you see anything?’\\nOn the far stage, under the distant lamps, they could just\\nmake out a figure: it looked like a dark black bundle left\\nbehind. But as they looked it seemed to move and sway this\\nway and that, as if searching the ground. It then crawled, or\\nwent crouching, back into the gloom beyond the lamps.\\n‘What in the Shire is that?’ exclaimed Merry.\\n‘Somethingthatisfollowingus,’saidFrodo.‘Butdon’task\\nany more now! Let’s get away at once!’ They hurried up the\\npath to the top of the bank, but when they looked back the\\nfar shore was shrouded in mist, and nothing could be seen.\\n‘Thank goodness you don’t keep any boats on the west-\\nbank!’ said Frodo. ‘Can horses cross the river?’\\n‘They can go ten miles north to Brandywine Bridge – or\\nthey might swim,’ answered Merry. ‘Though I never heard\\nof any horse swimming the Brandywine.

Frodo had chosen\\nit, because it stood in an out-of-the-way corner of the\\ncountry, and there were no other dwellings close by. You\\ncould get in and out without being noticed. It had been built\\nalongwhilebeforebytheBrandybucks,fortheuseofguests,\\nor members of the family that wished to escape from the\\ncrowded life of Brandy Hall for a time. It was an old-\\nfashioned countrified house, as much like a hobbit-hole as\\npossible: it was long and low, with no upper storey; and it\\nhad a roof of turf, round windows, and a large round door.\\nAs they walked up the green path from the gate no light\\nwas visible; the windows were dark and shuttered. Frodo\\nknocked on the door, and Fatty Bolger opened it. A friendly\\nlight streamed out. They slipped in quickly and shut them-\\nselves and the light inside. They were in a wide hall with\\ndoors on either side; in front of them a passage ran back\\ndown the middle of the house.\\n‘Well, what do you think of it?’ asked Merry coming up\\nthe passage. ‘We have done our best in a short time to make\\nit look like home.

Merry went in front leading a laden pony, and took\\nhis way along a path that went through a spinney behind the\\nhouse, and then cut across several fields. The leaves of trees\\nwere glistening, and every twig was dripping; the grass was\\ngreywithcolddew.Everythingwasstill,andfar-awaynoises\\nseemed near and clear: fowls chattering in a yard, someone\\nclosing a door of a distant house.\\nIn their shed they found the ponies: sturdy little beasts of\\nthe kind loved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for a long\\nday’s work. They mounted, and soon they were riding off\\ninto the mist, which seemed to open reluctantly before them\\nand close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for about\\nan hour, slowly and without talking, they saw the Hedge\\nlooming suddenly ahead.

After that thetrees gave up\\nthe attack, but they became very unfriendly.

But something makes\\npaths.Wheneveronecomesinsideonefindsopentracks;but\\nthey seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer\\nfashion.

On the far side was a faint path leading up on\\nto the floor of the Forest, a hundred yards and more beyond\\nthe Hedge; but it vanished as soon as it brought them under\\nthe trees. Looking back they could see the dark line of the\\nHedge through the stems of trees that were already thick\\nabout them. Looking ahead they could see only tree-trunks\\nof innumerable sizes and shapes: straight or bent, twisted,\\nleaning, squat or slender, smooth or gnarled and branched;\\nand all the stems were green or grey with moss and slimy,\\nshaggy growths.\\nMerry alone seemed fairly cheerful. ‘You had better lead\\non and find that path,’ Frodo said to him. ‘Don’t let us lose\\none another, or forget which way the Hedge lies!’\\nThey picked a way among the trees, and their ponies\\nplodded along, carefully avoiding the many writhing and\\ninterlacing roots. There was no undergrowth. The ground\",\"146 the fellowship of the ring\\nwas rising steadily, and as they went forward it seemed that\\nthe trees became taller, darker, and thicker. There was no\\nsound, except an occasional drip of moisture falling through\\nthe still leaves. For the moment there was no whispering or\\nmovement among the branches; but they all got an uncom-\\nfortable feeling that they were being watched with dis-\\napproval, deepening to dislike and even enmity.

The\\ndarktreesdrewaside,andaheadtheycouldseethepathgoing\\nalmost straight forward. Before them, but some distance off,\\nthere stood a green hill-top, treeless, rising like a bald head\\nout of the encircling wood.

In the\\nwest they could not make out either the line of the Hedge or\\nthe valley of the Brandywine beyond it. Northward, where\\ntheylookedmosthopefully,theycouldseenothingthatmight\\nbe the line of the great East Road, for which they were\\nmaking.

After some discussion they\\ndecided to leave this misleading path and strike northward;\\nforalthoughtheyhadnotbeenabletoseeitfromthehill-top,\\nthe Road must lie that way, and it could not be many miles\\noff. Also northward, and to the left of the path, the land\\nseemed to be drier and more open, climbing up to slopes\\nwhere the trees were thinner, and pines and firs replaced the\\noaks and ashes and other strange and nameless trees of the\\ndenser wood.\\nAt first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at\\na fair speed, though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun\\nin an open glade they seemed unaccountably to have veered\\neastwards. But after a time the trees began to close in again,\\njust where they had appeared from a distance to be thinner\\nand less tangled. Then deep folds in the ground were dis-\\ncovered unexpectedly, like the ruts of great giant-wheels or\\nwide moats and sunken roads long disused and choked with\\nbrambles.

It was so steep and overhung that it proved\",\"the old forest 151\\nimpossible to climb out of it again, either forwards or back-\\nwards,withoutleavingtheirponiesandtheirbaggagebehind.\\nAll they could do was to follow the fold – downwards. The\\nground grew soft, and in places boggy; springs appeared in\\nthebanks,andsoontheyfoundthemselvesfollowingabrook\\nthat trickled and babbled through a weedy bed. Then the\\nground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong\\nand noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in\\na deep dim-lit gully over-arched by trees high above them.\\nAfterstumblingalongforsomewayalongthestream,they\\ncame quite suddenly out of the gloom. As if through a gate\\nthey saw the sunlight before them. Coming to the opening\\nthey found that they had made their way down through a\\ncleft in a high steep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a\\nwide space of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be\\nglimpsed another bank almost as steep. A golden afternoon\\nof late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land\\nbetween. In the midst of it there wound lazily a dark river of\\nbrown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over\\nwith willows, blocked with fallen willows, and flecked with\\nthousands of faded willow-leaves. The air was thick with\\nthem, fluttering yellow from the branches; for there was a\\nwarm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley, and the\\nreeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking.\\n‘Well, now I have at least some notion of where we are!’\\nsaid Merry. ‘We have come almost in the opposite direction\\nto which we intended. This is the River Withywindle! I will\\ngo on and explore.’\\nHe passed out into the sunshine and disappeared into the\\nlong grasses. After a while he reappeared, and reported that\\nthere was fairly solid ground between the cliff-foot and the\\nriver;insomeplacesfirmturfwentdowntothewater’sedge.\\n‘What’s more,’ he said, ‘there seems to be something like a\\nfootpath winding along on this side of the river.

I don’t know in the least how\\nfar down the Withywindle we are, or who could possibly\\ncomehereoftenenoughtomakeapathalongit.Butthereis\\nno other way out that I can see or think of.’\\nThere being nothing else for it, they filed out, and Merry\\nled them to the path that he had discovered.

Here and there it passed over other rills,\\nrunning down gullies into the Withywindle out of the higher\\nforest-lands, and at these points there were tree-trunks or\\nbundles of brushwood laid carefully across.\\nThe hobbits began to feel very hot. There were armies of\\nflies of all kinds buzzing round their ears, and the afternoon\\nsun was burning on their backs. At last they came suddenly\\ninto a thin shade; great grey branches reached across the\\npath.Eachstepforwardbecamemorereluctantthanthelast.\\nSleepiness seemed to be creeping out of the ground and up\\ntheir legs, and falling softly out of the air upon their heads\\nand eyes.\\nFrodofelthischingodownandhisheadnod.Justinfront\\nofhimPippinfellforwardontohisknees.Frodohalted.‘It’s\\nnogood,’heheardMerrysaying.‘Can’tgoanotherstepwith-\\noutrest.Musthavenap.It’scoolunderthewillows.Lessflies!’\\nFrodo did not like the sound of this. ‘Come on!’ he cried.\\n‘We can’t have a nap yet.

His\",\"the old forest 153\\nhead swam. There now seemed hardly a sound in the air.\\nThe flies had stopped buzzing. Only a gentle noise on the\\nedge of hearing, a soft fluttering as of a song half whispered,\\nseemed to stir in the boughs above.

He was worried. Theafternoon was getting late, and\\nhe thought this sudden sleepiness uncanny. ‘There’s more\\nbehind this than sun and warm air,’ he muttered to himself.\\n‘I don’t like this great big tree. I don’t trust it. Hark at it\\nsinging about sleep now! This won’t do at all!’\",\"154 the fellowship of the ring\\nHepulledhimselftohisfeet,andstaggeredofftoseewhat\\nhad become of the ponies. He found that two had wandered\\non a good way along the path; and he had just caught them\\nand brought them back towards the others, when he heard\\ntwo noises; one loud, and the other soft but very clear. One\\nwas the splash of something heavy falling into the water; the\\nother was a noise like the snick of a lock when a door quietly\\ncloses fast.\\nHe rushed back to the bank. Frodo was in the water close\\nto theedge, anda great tree-rootseemed tobe over himand\\nholding him down, but he was not struggling.

Little fingers of fire\\nlicked against the dry scored rind of the ancient tree and\\nscorched it. A tremor ran through the whole willow. The\\nleaves seemed to hiss above their heads with a sound of pain\\nand anger. A loud scream came from Merry, and from far\\ninside the tree they heard Pippin give a muffled yell.\\n‘Put it out! Put it out!’ cried Merry. ‘He’ll squeeze me in\\ntwo, if you don’t. He says so!’\\n‘Who?

He turned round and\\nlistened, and soon there could be no doubt: someone was\\nsinging a song; a deep glad voice was singing carelessly and\\nhappily, but it was singing nonsense:\\nHey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!\\nRing a dong! hop along! fal lal the willow!\\nTom Bom, jolly Tom, Tom Bombadillo!\\nHalf hopeful and half afraid of some new danger, Frodo\\nand Sam now both stood still.

They came to a low room\\nwith a sloping roof (a penthouse, it seemed, built on to the\\nnorth end of the house). Its walls were of clean stone, but\\ntheyweremostlycoveredwithgreenhangingmatsandyellow\\ncurtains. The floor was flagged, and strewn with fresh green\\nrushes.

Sleep gathered on\\ntheir eyelids. At last Frodo spoke:\\n‘Didyouhearmecalling,Master,orwasitjustchancethat\\nbrought you at that moment?’\\nTom stirred like a man shaken out of a pleasant dream.\\n‘Eh, what?’ said he. ‘Did I hear you calling?

The figure lifted his\\narms and a light flashed from the staff that he wielded. A\\nmighty eagle swept down and bore him away. The voices\\nwailed and the wolves yammered.

He\\nlay motionless, still listening; but all was now silent, and at\\nlast he turned and fell asleep again or wandered into some\\nother unremembered dream.\\nAt his side Pippin lay dreaming pleasantly; but a change\\ncame over his dreams and he turned and groaned. Suddenly\",\"in the house of tom bombadil 167\\nhe woke, or thought he had waked, and yet still heard in the\\ndarkness the sound that had disturbed his dream: tip-tap,\\nsqueak: the noise was like branches fretting in the wind,\\ntwig-fingers scraping wall and window: creak, creak, creak.\\nHe wondered if there were willow-trees close to the house;\\nand then suddenly he had a dreadful feeling that he was not\\ninanordinaryhouseatall,butinsidethewillowandlistening\\nto that horrible dry creaking voice laughing at him again.

The Forest was hidden under a fog. It was like\\nlooking down on to a sloping cloud-roof from above. There\\nwas a fold or channel where the mist was broken into many\\nplumes and billows: the valley of the Withywindle. The\\nstream ran down the hill on the left and vanished into the\\nwhite shadows. Near at hand was a flower-garden and a\\nclipped hedge silver-netted, and beyond that grey shaven\\ngrass pale with dew-drops. There was no willow-tree to be\\nseen.\\n‘Good morning, merry friends!’ cried Tom, opening the\\neastern window wide. A cool air flowed in; it had a rainy\\nsmell. ‘Sun won’t show her face much today, I’m thinking. I\\nhave been walking wide, leaping on the hill-tops, since the\\ngreydawnbegan,nosingwindandweather,wetgrassunder-\\nfoot, wet sky above me.

Neither\\nTom nor Goldberry were there. Tom could be heard about\\nthe house, clattering in the kitchen, and up and down the\\nstairs, and singing here and there outside. The room looked\",\"in the house of tom bombadil 169\\nwestward over the mist-clouded valley, and the window was\\nopen. Water dripped down from the thatched eaves above.\\nBeforetheyhadfinishedbreakfastthecloudshadjoinedinto\\nan unbroken roof, and a straight grey rain came softly and\\nsteadily down.

Nothing could be seen all round the house but\\nfalling water. Frodo stood near the open door and watched\\nthe white chalky path turn into a little river of milk and go\\nbubbling away down into the valley. Tom Bombadil came\\ntrotting round the corner of the house, waving his arms as if\\nhe was warding off the rain – and indeed when he sprang\\nover the threshold he seemedquite dry, except for his boots.\\nThese he took off and put in the chimney-corner. Then he\\nsatinthelargestchairandcalledthehobbitstogatherround\\nhim.\\n‘This is Goldberry’s washing day,’ he said, ‘and her\\nautumn-cleaning.

Moving\\nconstantly in and out of his talk was Old Man Willow, and\\nFrodolearnednowenoughtocontenthim,indeedmorethan\\nenough, for it was not comfortable lore. Tom’s words laid\\nbare the hearts of trees and their thoughts, which were often\\ndarkandstrange,andfilledwithahatredofthingsthatgofree\\nupon the earth, gnawing, biting, breaking, hacking, burning:\\ndestroyers and usurpers. It was not called the Old Forest\\nwithout reason, for it was indeed ancient, a survivor of vast\\nforgotten woods; and in it there lived yet, ageing no quicker\\nthanthehills,thefathersofthefathersoftrees,remembering\\ntimes when they were lords. The countless years had filled\\nthem with pride and rooted wisdom, and with malice. But\\nnone were more dangerous than the Great Willow: his heart\\nwas rotten, but his strength was green; and he was cunning,\\nandamasterofwinds,andhissongandthoughtranthrough\\nthe woods on both sides of the river.

They heard\\nof the Great Barrows, and the green mounds, and the stone-\\nringsuponthehillsandinthehollowsamongthehills.Sheep\\nwere bleating in flocks.

Gold was piled on the biers of dead\\nkings and queens; and mounds covered them, and the stone\\ndoors were shut; and the grass grew over all. Sheep walked\\nfor a while biting the grass, but soon the hills were empty\\nagain. A shadow came out of dark places far away, and the\\nbones were stirred in the mounds. Barrow-wights walked in\\nthe hollow places with a clink of rings on cold fingers, and\\ngoldchainsinthewind.Stoneringsgrinnedoutoftheground\\nlike broken teeth in the moonlight.\\nThe hobbits shuddered. Even in the Shire the rumour of\\nthe Barrow-wights of the Barrow-downs beyond the Forest\\nhad been heard.

They lost the\\nthread of his tale and shifted uneasily, looking aside at one\\nanother.\\nWhen they caught his words again they found that he had\\nnowwanderedintostrangeregionsbeyondtheirmemoryand\\nbeyondtheir wakingthought,into timeswhenthe worldwas\\nwider,andtheseasflowedstraighttothewesternShore;and\\nstillonandbackTomwentsingingoutintoancientstarlight,\\nwhen only the Elf-sires were awake. Then suddenly he\\nstopped, and they saw that he nodded as if he was falling\\nasleep. The hobbits sat still before him, enchanted; and it\\nseemed as if, under the spell of his words, the wind had\\ngone, and the clouds had dried up, and the day had been\\nwithdrawn,anddarknesshadcomefromEastandWest,and\\nall the sky was filled with the light of white stars.\\nWhether the morning and evening of one day or of many\\ndays had passed Frodo could not tell. He did not feel either\\nhungry or tired, only filled with wonder. The stars shone\\nthrough the window and the silence of the heavens seemed\",\"172 the fellowship of the ring\\nto be round him. He spoke at last out of his wonder and a\\nsudden fear of that silence:\\n‘Who are you, Master?’ he asked.\\n‘Eh, what?’ said Tom sitting up, and his eyes glinting in\\nthe gloom. ‘Don’t you know my name yet? That’s the only\\nanswer.Tellme,whoare you,alone,yourselfandnameless?\\nBut you are young and I am old. Eldest, that’s what I am.\\nMark my words, my friends: Tom was here before the river\\nandthetrees;Tomremembersthefirstraindropandthefirst\\nacorn.

When the Elves passed west-\\nward, Tom was here already, before the seas were bent. He\\nknew the dark under the stars when it was fearless – before\\nthe Dark Lord came from Outside.’\\nA shadow seemed to pass by the window, and the hobbits\\nglanced hastily through the panes.

Then\\nTom and Goldberry set the table; and the hobbits sat half in\\nwonder and half in laughter: so fair was the grace of Gold-\\nberry and so merry and odd the caperings of Tom.

Then once more she wished them each good night\\nand left them by the fireside. But Tom now seemed wide\\nawake and plied them with questions.\\nHe appeared already to know much about them and all\\ntheir families, and indeed to know much of all the history\\nanddoings ofthe Shiredown fromdayshardly remembered\\namong the hobbits themselves. It no longer surprised them;\\nbut he made no secret that he owed his recent knowledge\\nlargely to Farmer Maggot, whom he seemed to regard as a\\npersonofmoreimportancethantheyhadimagined.‘There’s\\nearth under his old feet, and clay on his fingers; wisdom in\\nhisbones,andbothhis eyesareopen,’saidTom.Itwasalso\\nclear that Tom had dealings with the Elves, and it seemed\\nthat in some fashion, news had reached him from Gildor\\nconcerning the flight of Frodo.\\nIndeed so much did Tom know, and so cunning was his\\nquestioning,thatFrodofoundhimselftellinghimmoreabout\\nBilbo and his own hopes and fears than he had told before\",\"174 the fellowship of the ring\\neven to Gandalf.

But in the\\nwild lands beyond Bree there were mysterious wanderers.\\nThe Bree-folk called them Rangers, and knew nothing of\\ntheir origin. They were taller and darker than the Men of\\nBree and were believed to have strange powers of sight\\nand hearing, and to understand the languages of beasts\\nand birds. They roamed at will southwards, and eastwards\\neven as far as the Misty Mountains; but they were now\\nfew and rarely seen.

Nowhere else in the world was this\\npeculiar (but excellent) arrangement to be found.\\nThe Bree-folk, Big and Little, did not themselves travel\\nmuch; and the affairs of the four villages were their chief\\nconcern.

An\\noccasionalBucklanderoradventurousTookwouldcomeout\\nto the Inn for a night or two, but even that was becoming\\nless and less usual. The Shire-hobbits referred to those of\\nBree, and to any others that lived beyond the borders, as\\nOutsiders, and took very little interest in them, considering\\nthem dull and uncouth. There were probably many more\\nOutsiders scattered about in the West of the World in those\\ndaysthanthepeopleoftheShireimagined.Some,doubtless,\\nwere no better than tramps, ready to dig a hole in any bank\\nand stay only as long as it suited them.

It would be more homelike.’\\n‘What’s wrong with the inn?’ said Frodo. ‘Tom Bombadil\\nrecommended it.

It had a front on the Road, and two wings\\nrunning back on land partly cut out of the lower slopes of\\nthe hill, so that at the rear the second-floor windows were\\nlevel with the ground.

The strangers, especially\\nthose that had come up the Greenway, stared at them\",\"at the sign of the prancing pony 203\\ncuriously.

The\\nMugworts,forinstance,seemednumerous.Butmostofthem\\nhad natural names, such as Banks, Brockhouse, Longholes,\\nSandheaver, and Tunnelly, many of which were used in the\\nShire. There were several Underhills from Staddle, and as\\ntheycouldnotimaginesharinganamewithoutbeingrelated,\\nthey took Frodo to their hearts as a long-lost cousin.\\nThe Bree-hobbits were, in fact, friendly and inquisitive,\\nandFrodosoonfoundthatsomeexplanationofwhathewas\\ndoing would have to be given.

He said he was thinking of\\nwriting a book (at which there was silent astonishment), and\\nthat he and his friends wanted to collect information about\\nhobbits living outside the Shire, especially in the eastern\\nlands.\\nAt this a chorus of voices broke out. If Frodo had really\\nwanted to write a book, and had had many ears, he would\\nhave learned enough for several chapters in a few minutes.\\nAnd if that was not enough, he was given a whole list of\\nnames, beginning with ‘Old Barliman here’, to whom he\\ncould go for further information.

The local inhabitants did not look pleased at\\nthe prospect.\\nThe hobbits did not pay much attention to all this, as it\\ndid not at the moment seem to concern hobbits.

But there were several questions\\nasked that made Frodo a little uneasy. One of the Bree-\\nlanders, who seemed to have been in the Shire several times,\\nwanted to know where the Underhills lived and who they\\nwere related to.\\nSuddenly Frodo noticed that a strange-looking weather-\\nbeaten man, sitting in the shadows near the wall, was also\\nlistening intently to the hobbit-talk.

He felt the Ring on its chain, and quite unac-\\ncountably the desire came over him to slip it on and vanish\\nout of the silly situation. It seemed to him, somehow, as if\\nthe suggestion came to him from outside, from someone or\\nsomething in the room. He resisted the temptation firmly,\\nand clasped the Ring in his hand, as if to keep a hold on it\\nand prevent it from escaping or doing any mischief. At any\\nrate it gave him no inspiration.

He writes as if he was\\ngoing into great danger.’\\n‘He has been doing that for many years,’ said Strider.\\nFrodo turned and looked at him thoughtfully, wondering\\nabout Gandalf’s second postscript. ‘Why didn’t you tell me\\nthat you were Gandalf’s friend at once?’ he asked. ‘It would\\nhave saved time.’\\n‘Would it? Would any of you have believed me till now?’\\nsaid Strider. ‘I knew nothing of this letter. For all I knew I\\nhad to persuade you to trust me without proofs, if I was to\\nhelp you. In any case, I did not intend to tell you all about\\nmyself at once. I had to study you first, and make sure\\nof you. The Enemy has set traps for me before now.

The flies began to torment\\nthem, and the air was full of clouds of tiny midges that crept\\nup their sleeves and breeches and into their hair.\",\"a knife in the dark 239\\n‘I am being eaten alive!’ cried Pippin. ‘Midgewater! There\\nare more midges than water!’\\n‘What do they live on when they can’t get hobbit?’ asked\\nSam, scratching his neck.\\nThey spent a miserable day in this lonely and unpleasant\\ncountry.

Though the Neekerbreekers (as Sam\\ncalled them) had been left behind, the midges still pursued\\nthem.\\nAs Frodo lay, tired but unable to close his eyes, it seemed\\nto him that far away there came a light in the eastern sky: it\\nflashed and faded many times. It was not the dawn, for that\\nwas still some hours off.\\n‘What is the light?’ he said to Strider, who had risen, and\\nwas standing, gazing ahead into the night.\\n‘Idonotknow,’Strideranswered.‘Itistoodistanttomake\\nout. It is like lightning that leaps up from the hill-tops.’\\nFrodo lay down again, but for a long while he could still\\nsee the white flashes, and against them the tall dark figure of\\nStrider, standing silent and watchful. At last he passed into\\nuneasy sleep.\\nThey had not gone far on the fifth day when they left the\\nlast straggling pools and reed-beds of the marshes behind\\nthem. The land before them began steadily to rise again.\\nAway in the distance eastward they could now see a line of\\nhills. The highest of them was at the right of the line and a\\nlittle separated from the others. It had a conical top, slightly\\nflattened at the summit.\\n‘That is Weathertop,’ said Strider. ‘The Old Road, which\",\"240 the fellowship of the ring\\nwehaveleftfarawayonourright,runstothesouthofitand\\npasses not far from its foot. We might reach it by noon\\ntomorrow, if we go straight towards it. I suppose we had\\nbetter do so.’\\n‘What do you mean?’ asked Frodo.\\n‘I mean: when we do get there, it is not certain what we\\nshall find. It is close to the Road.’\\n‘But surely we were hoping to find Gandalf there?’\\n‘Yes; but the hope is faint. If he comes this way at all, he\\nmay not pass through Bree, and so he may not know what\\nwe are doing. And anyway, unless by luck we arrive almost\\ntogether,weshallmissoneanother;itwillnotbesafeforhim\\nor for us to wait there long. If the Riders fail to find us in\\nthe wilderness, they are likelyto make for Weathertop them-\\nselves. It commands a wide view all round. Indeed, there are\\nmany birds and beasts in this country that could see us, as\\nwe stand here, from that hill-top. Not all the birds are to be\\ntrusted, and there are other spies more evil than they are.’\\nThe hobbits looked anxiously at the distant hills. Sam\\nlooked up into the pale sky, fearing to see hawks or eagles\\nhovering over them with bright unfriendly eyes. ‘You do\\nmakemefeeluncomfortableandlonesome,Strider!’hesaid.\\n‘What do you advise us to do?’ asked Frodo.\\n‘I think,’ answered Strider slowly, as if he was not quite\\nsure,‘Ithinkthebestthingistogoasstraighteastwardfrom\\nhere as we can, to make for the line of hills, not for\\nWeathertop. There we can strike a path I know that runs at\\ntheir feet; it will bring us to Weathertop from the north and\\nless openly.

They made an undulating ridge,\\noften rising almost to a thousand feet, and here and there\\nfalling again to low clefts or passes leading into the eastern\\nland beyond. Along the crest of the ridge the hobbits could\\nsee what looked to be the remains of green-grown walls and\\ndikes,andinthecleftstherestillstoodtheruinsofoldworks\\nof stone.

It dived into dells, and hugged steep banks; and\\nwhere it passed over flatter and more open ground on either\\nside of it there were lines of large boulders and hewn stones\\nthat screened the travellers almost like a hedge.\\n‘I wonder who made this path, and what for,’ said Merry,\\nas they walked along one of these avenues, where the stones\\nwereunusuallylargeandcloselyset.‘IamnotsurethatIlike\\nit: it has a – well, rather a barrow-wightish look. Is there any\\nbarrow on Weathertop?’\\n‘No. There is no barrow on Weathertop, nor on any of\\nthese hills,’ answered Strider. ‘The Men of the West did not\\nlive here; though in their latter days they defended the hills\\nfor a while against the evil that came out of Angmar. This\\npath was made to serve the forts along the walls.

But in the centre a cairn of broken stones had been\\npiled. They were blackened as if with fire. About them the\\nturf was burned to the roots and all within the ring the grass\\nwas scorched and shrivelled, as if flames had swept the hill-\\ntop; but there was no sign of any living thing.\\nStanding upon the rim of the ruined circle, they saw all\\nroundbelowthemawideprospect,forthemostpartoflands\\nempty and featureless, except for patches of woodland away\\nto the south, beyond which they caught here and there the\\nglint of distant water.

His eyes\",\"254 the fellowship of the ring\\nshone, and his voice was rich and deep. Above him was a\\nblack starry sky. Suddenly a pale light appeared over the\\ncrown of Weathertop behind him.

Then setting it aside, he turned to Frodo and in a\\nsoft tone spoke words the others could not catch. From the\\npouch at his belt he drew out the long leaves of a plant.\\n‘These leaves,’ he said, ‘I have walked far to find; for\\nthis plant does not grow in the bare hills; but in the thickets\\naway south of the Road I found it in the dark by the scent\\nof itsleaves.’ Hecrushed aleaf inhis fingers,and it gaveout\\na sweet and pungent fragrance. ‘It is fortunate that I could\\nfind it, for it is a healing plant that the Men of the West\\nbroughttoMiddle-earth.Athelastheynamedit,anditgrows\\nnow sparsely and only near places where they dwelt or\\ncamped of old; and it is not known in the North, except to\\nsome of those who wander in the Wild.

The fragrance of the steam was refreshing, and\\nthose that were unhurt felt their minds calmed and cleared.\\nThe herb had also some power over the wound, for Frodo\\nfelt the pain and also the sense of frozen cold lessen in his\\nside; but the life did not return to his arm, and he could not\\nraise or use his hand. He bitterly regretted his foolishness,\\nand reproached himself for weakness of will; for he now\\nperceived that in putting on the Ring he obeyed not his\\nown desire but the commanding wish of his enemies. He\\nwondered if he would remain maimed for life, and how they\",\"260 the fellowship of the ring\\nwould now manage to continue their journey. He felt too\\nweak to stand.\\nThe others were discussing this very question. They\\nquickly decided to leave Weathertop as soon as possible. ‘I\\nthink now,’ said Strider, ‘that the enemy has been watching\\nthis place for some days. If Gandalf ever came here, then he\\nmust have been forced to ride away, and he will not return.\\nIn any case we are in great peril here after dark, since the\\nattack of last night, and we can hardly meet greater danger\\nwherever we go.’\\nAs soon as the daylight was full, they had some hurried\\nfoodandpacked.ItwasimpossibleforFrodotowalk,sothey\\ndivided the greater part of their baggage among the four of\\nthem, and put Frodo on the pony.

And they needed fuel; for Strider said that\\nFrodo must be kept warm, especially at night, while fire\\nwould be some protection for them all. It was also his plan\\nto shorten their journey by cutting across another great loop\\nof the Road: east beyond Weathertop it changed its course\\nand took a wide bend northwards.\\nThey made their way slowly and cautiously round the\\nsouth-western slopes of the hill, and came in a little while to\\nthe edge of the Road. There was no sign of the Riders. But\\neven as they were hurrying across they heard far away two\\ncries: a cold voice calling and a cold voice answering.

Strider now turned their course again north-\\neastwards, and on the sixth day they reached the top of a\\nlong slow-climbing slope, and saw far ahead a huddle of\\nwooded hills. Away below them they could see the Road\\nsweeping round the feet of the hills; and to their right a grey\\nriver gleamed pale in the thin sunshine. In the distance they\\nglimpsed yet another river in a stony valley half-veiled in\\nmist.\\n‘IamafraidwemustgobacktotheRoadhereforawhile,’\\nsaid Strider. ‘We have now come to the River Hoarwell, that\\ntheElvescallMitheithel.ItflowsdownoutoftheEttenmoors,\\nthe troll-fells north of Rivendell, and joins the Loudwater\",\"262 the fellowship of the ring\\naway in the South.

One river at a\\ntime! Weshall befortunate indeed ifwe donot find theLast\\nBridge held against us.’\\nNext day, early in the morning, they came down again to\\nthe borders of the Road. Sam and Strider went forward, but\\ntheyfoundnosignofanytravellersorriders.Hereunderthe\\nshadow of the hills there had been some rain. Strider judged\\nthat it had fallen two days before, and had washed away all\\nfootprints. No horseman had passed since then, as far as he\\ncould see.\\nThey hurried along with all the speed they could make,\\nand after a mile or two they saw the Last Bridge ahead, at\\nthe bottom of a short steep slope. They dreaded to see black\\nfigures waiting there, but they saw none. Strider made them\\ntake cover in a thicket at the side of the Road, while he went\\nforward to explore.\\nBefore long he came hurrying back. ‘I can see no sign of\\nthe enemy,’ he said, ‘and I wonder very much what that\\nmeans. But I have found something very strange.’\\nHeheldouthishand,andshowedasinglepale-greenjewel.\\n‘I found it in the mud in the middle of the Bridge,’ he said.\\n‘It is a beryl, an elf-stone.

They crossed the Bridge in\\nsafety, hearing no sound but the water swirling against its\\nthree great arches. A mile further on they came to a narrow\\nravine that led away northwards through the steep lands on\\ntheleftoftheRoad.HereStriderturnedaside,andsoonthey\\nwere lost in a sombre country of dark trees winding among\\nthe feet of sullen hills.\\nThe hobbits were glad to leave the cheerless lands and\\ntheperilousRoadbehindthem;butthisnewcountryseemed\\nthreatening and unfriendly. As they went forward the hills\\nabout them steadily rose. Here and there upon heights and\\nridges they caught glimpses of ancient walls of stone, and\\nthe ruins of towers: they had an ominous look. Frodo, who\\nwas not walking, had time to gaze ahead and to think. He\\nrecalled Bilbo’s account of his journey and the threatening\\ntowers on the hills north of the Road, in the country near\\nthe Trolls’ wood where his first serious adventure had\\nhappened. Frodo guessed that they were now in the same\\nregion, and wondered if by chance they would pass near\\nthe spot.\\n‘Who lives in this land?’ he asked. ‘And who built these\\ntowers? Is this troll-country?’\\n‘No!’saidStrider.‘Trollsdonotbuild.Noonelivesinthis\\nland. Men once dwelt here, ages ago; but none remain now.\\nThey became an evil people, as legends tell, for they fell\\nunder the shadow of Angmar. But all were destroyed in the\\nwar that brought the North Kingdom to its end. But that is\\nnow so long ago that the hills have forgotten them, though a\\nshadow still lies on the land.’\\n‘Where did you learn such tales, if all the land is empty\\nand forgetful?’ asked Peregrin. ‘The birds and beasts do not\\ntell tales of that sort.’\\n‘The heirs of Elendil do not forget all things past,’ said\\nStrider; ‘and many more things than I can tell are remem-\\nbered in Rivendell.’\\n‘Have you often been to Rivendell?’ said Frodo.\\n‘I have,’ said Strider. ‘I dwelt there once, and still I return\",\"264 the fellowship of the ring\\nwhen I may. There my heart is; but it is not my fate to sit in\\npeace, even in the fair house of Elrond.’\\nThe hills now began to shut them in. The Road behind\\nheld on its way to the River Bruinen, but both were now\\nhidden from view. The travellers came into a long valley;\\nnarrow, deeply cloven, dark and silent. Trees with old and\\ntwisted roots hung over cliffs, and piled up behind into\\nmounting slopes of pine-wood.\\nThe hobbits grew very weary.

Strider seemed to be getting anxi-\\nous: they were nearly ten days out from Weathertop, and\\ntheir stock of provisions was beginning to run low.

He felt that black shapes were\\nadvancingtosmotherhim;butwhenhesatuphesawnothing\\nbutthebackofStridersittinghunchedup,smokinghispipe,\\nand watching. He lay down again and passed into an uneasy\\ndream, in which he walked on the grass in his garden in the\",\"flight to the ford 265\\nShire, but it seemed faint and dim, less clear than the tall\\nblack shadows that stood looking over the hedge.\\nIn the morning he woke to find that the rain had stopped.\\nThe clouds were still thick, but they were breaking, and pale\\nstripsofblueappearedbetweenthem.Thewindwasshifting\\nagain. They did not start early. Immediately after their cold\\nand comfortless breakfast Strider went off alone, telling the\\nothers to remain under the shelter of the cliff, until he came\\nback. He was going to climb up, if he could, and get a look\\nat the lie of the land.\\nWhen he returned he was not reassuring. ‘We have come\\ntoo farto thenorth,’ he said,‘and wemust find someway to\\nturn back southwards again. If we keep on as we are going\\nwe shall get up into the Ettendales far north of Rivendell.\\nThat is troll-country, and little known to me.

They found a passage between two hills that led\\ntheminto avalley runningsouth-east, thedirectionthat they\\nwished to take; but towards the end of the day they found\\ntheir road again barred by a ridge of high land; its dark edge\\nagainst the sky was broken into many bare points like teeth\\nof a blunted saw. They had a choice between going back or\\nclimbing over it.\\nThey decided to attempt the climb, but it proved very\\ndifficult. Before long Frodo was obliged to dismount and\\nstrugglealongonfoot.Evensotheyoftendespairedofgetting\\ntheir pony up, or indeed of finding a path for themselves,\\nburdened as they were. The light was nearly gone, and they\\nwere all exhausted, when at last they reached the top.

Frodo threw himself down, and lay on the ground\",\"266 the fellowship of the ring\\nshivering.Hisleftarmwaslifeless,andhissideandshoulder\\nfelt as if icy claws were laid upon them. The trees and rocks\\nabout him seemed shadowy and dim.\\n‘We cannot go any further,’ said Merry to Strider. ‘I am\\nafraid this has been too much for Frodo. I am dreadfully\\nanxious about him. What are we to do? Do you think they\\nwill be able to cure him in Rivendell, if we ever get there?’\\n‘We shall see,’ answered Strider. ‘There is nothing more\\nthat I can do in the wilderness; and it is chiefly because of\\nhis wound that I am so anxious to press on. But I agree that\\nwe can go no further tonight.’\\n‘What is the matter with my master?’ asked Sam in a low\\nvoice, looking appealingly at Strider. ‘His wound was small,\\nanditisalreadyclosed.There’snothingtobeseenbutacold\\nwhite mark on his shoulder.’\\n‘Frodo has been touched by the weapons of the Enemy,’\\nsaid Strider, ‘and there is some poison or evil at work that\\nis beyond my skill to drive out. But do not give up hope,\\nSam!’\\nNight was cold up on the high ridge. They lit a small fire\\ndown under the gnarled roots of an old pine, that hung over\\na shallow pit: it looked as if stone had once been quarried\\nthere. They sat huddled together. The wind blew chill\\nthrough the pass, and they heard the tree-tops lower down\\nmoaning and sighing. Frodo lay half in a dream, imagining\\nthat endless dark wings were sweeping by above him, and\\nthat on the wings rode pursuers that sought him in all the\\nhollows of the hills.\\nThe morning dawned bright and fair; the air was clean,\\nandthelightpaleandclearinarain-washedsky.Theirhearts\\nwere encouraged, but they longed for the sun to warm their\\ncold stiff limbs.

If they\",\"flight to the ford 267\\nwent on, down the further side of the ridge, they would\\nhave the Mountains on their left. Some way ahead Strider\\nhad caught a glimpse of the Loudwater again, and he knew\\nthat, though it was hidden from view, the Road to the Ford\\nwas not far from the River and lay on the side nearest to\\nthem.\\n‘We must make for the Road again,’ he said. ‘We cannot\\nhopetofindapaththroughthesehills.Whateverdangermay\\nbeset it, the Road is our only way to the Ford.’\\nAssoonastheyhadeatentheysetoutagain.Theyclimbed\\nslowly down the southern side of the ridge; but the way was\\nmuch easier than they had expected, for the slope was far\\nless steep on this side, and before long Frodo was able to\\nride again. Bill Ferny’s poor old pony was developing an\\nunexpected talent for picking out a path, and for sparing its\\nrider as many jolts as possible. The spirits of the party rose\\nagain. Even Frodo felt better in the morning light, but every\\nnow and again a mist seemed to obscure his sight, and he\\npassed his hands over his eyes.\\nPippinwasalittleaheadoftheothers.Suddenlyheturned\\nround and called to them. ‘There is a path here!’ he cried.\\nWhen they came up with him, they saw that he had made\\nno mistake: there were clearly the beginnings of a path, that\\nclimbed with many windings out of the woods below and\\nfaded away on the hill-top behind. In places it was now faint\\nand overgrown, or choked with fallen stones and trees; but\\nat one time it seemed to have been much used.

There was a cave or\\nrock-chamber behind, but in the gloom inside nothing could\\nbe seen. Strider, Sam, and Merry pushing with all their\\nstrength managed to open the door a little wider, and then\\nStrider and Merry went in.

Sam never quite trusted him, I think,\\nnot at any rate until we met Glorfindel.’\\nGandalf smiled. ‘I have heard all about Sam,’ he said. ‘He\\nhas no more doubts now.’\\n‘I am glad,’ said Frodo. ‘For I have become very fond of\\nStrider. Well, fond is not the right word. I mean he is dear to\\nme; though he is strange, and grim at times. In fact, he\\nreminds me often of you. I didn’t know that any of the Big\\nPeoplewerelikethat. Ithought,well,thattheywere justbig,\\nand rather stupid: kind and stupid like Butterbur; or stupid\\nand wicked like Bill Ferny. But then we don’t know much\\nabout Men in the Shire, except perhaps the Bree-landers.’\\n‘You don’t know much even about them, if you think old\\nBarliman is stupid,’ said Gandalf. ‘He is wise enough on his\\nown ground. He thinks less than he talks, and slower; yet he\\ncan see through a brick wall in time (as they say in Bree).\\nBut there are few left in Middle-earth like Aragorn son of\\nArathorn. The race of the Kings from over the Sea is nearly\\nat an end. It may be that this War of the Ring will be their\\nlast adventure.’\\n‘Do you really mean that Strider is one of the people of\\ntheoldKings?’saidFrodoinwonder.‘Ithoughttheyhadall\\nvanished long ago. I thought he was only a Ranger.’\",\"288 the fellowship of the ring\\n‘Only a Ranger!’ cried Gandalf. ‘My dear Frodo, that is\\njust what the Rangers are: the last remnant in the North of\\nthegreatpeople,theMenoftheWest.Theyhavehelpedme\\nbefore; and I shall need their help in the days to come; for\\nwe have reached Rivendell, but the Ring is not yet at rest.’\\n‘I suppose not,’ said Frodo. ‘But so far my only thought\\nhas been to get here; and I hope I shan’t have to go any\\nfurther. It is very pleasant just to rest. I have had a month of\\nexile and adventure, and I find that has been as much as I\\nwant.’\\nHe fell silent and shut his eyes. After a while he spoke\\nagain. ‘I have been reckoning,’ he said, ‘and I can’t bring\\nthe total up to October the twenty-fourth. It ought to be\\nthe twenty-first. We must have reached the Ford by the\\ntwentieth.’\\n‘Youhavetalkedandreckonedmorethanisgoodforyou,’\\nsaid Gandalf. ‘How do the side and shoulder feel now?’\\n‘I don’t know,’ Frodo answered. ‘They don’t feel at all:\\nwhich is an improvement, but’ – he made an effort – ‘I can\\nmove my arm again a little.

But\\nwhy could we all see their horses?’\\n‘Because they are real horses; just as the black robes are\\nreal robes that they wear to give shape to their nothingness\\nwhen they have dealings with the living.’\\n‘Then why do these black horses endure such riders? All\\nother animals are terrified when they draw near, even the\\nelf-horse of Glorfindel.

Your friends\\ncrossed after the flood had passed and they found you lying\\non your face at the top of the bank, with a broken sword\\nunder you. The horse was standing guard beside you. You\\nwere pale and cold, and they feared that you were dead, or\\nworse. Elrond’s folk met them, carrying you slowly towards\\nRivendell.’\\n‘Who made the flood?’ asked Frodo.\\n‘Elrond commanded it,’ answered Gandalf. ‘The river of\\nthis valley is under his power, and it will rise in anger when\\nhe has great need to bar the Ford. As soon as the captain of\\nthe Ringwraiths rode into the water the flood was released.\\nIf I may say so, I added a few touches of my own: you may\\nnot have noticed, but some of the waves took the form of\\ngreat white horses with shining white riders; and there were\\nmany rolling and grinding boulders. For a moment I was\\nafraid that we had let loose too fierce a wrath, and the flood\\nwould get out of hand and wash you all away.

He got out of bed and discovered\\nthat his arm was already nearly as useful again as it ever had\\nbeen.Hefoundlaidreadycleangarmentsofgreencloththat\\nfitted him excellently. Looking in a mirror he was startled to\\nseeamuchthinnerreflectionofhimselfthanheremembered:\\nit looked remarkably like the young nephew of Bilbo who\\nused to go tramping with his uncle in the Shire; but the eyes\\nlooked out at him thoughtfully.\\n‘Yes, you have seen a thing or two since you last peeped\\nout of a looking-glass,’ he said to his reflection. ‘But now for\\na merry meeting!’ He stretched out his arms and whistled a\\ntune.\\nAt that moment there was a knock on the door, and Sam\\ncame in. He ran to Frodo and took his left hand, awkwardly\\nand shyly. He stroked it gently and then he blushed and\\nturned hastily away.\\n‘Hullo, Sam!’ said Frodo.\\n‘It’s warm!’ said Sam. ‘Meaning your hand, Mr. Frodo. It\\nhas felt so cold through the long nights. But glory and trum-\\npets!’ he cried, turning round again with shining eyes and\\ndancing on the floor. ‘It’s fine to see you up and yourself\\nagain, sir!

Shadows had fallen in the valley below,\\nbut there was still a light on the faces of the mountains far\\nabove. The air was warm. The sound of running and falling\\nwater was loud, and the evening was filled with a faint scent\\nof trees and flowers, as if summer still lingered in Elrond’s\\ngardens.\\n‘Hurray!’ cried Pippin, springing up. ‘Here is our noble\\ncousin! Make way for Frodo, Lord of the Ring!’\\n‘Hush!’ said Gandalf from the shadows at the back of the\\nporch. ‘Evil things do not come into this valley; but all the\\nsameweshouldnotnamethem.TheLordoftheRingisnot\\nFrodo, but the master of the Dark Tower of Mordor, whose\\npower is again stretching out over the world.

But it seems\\nimpossible, somehow, to feel gloomy or depressed in this\\nplace. I feel I could sing, if I knew the right song for the\\noccasion.’\\n‘I feel like singing myself,’ laughed Frodo. ‘Though at the\\nmoment I feel more like eating and drinking.’\\n‘That will soon be cured,’ said Pippin. ‘You have shown\\nyour usual cunning in getting up just in time for a meal.’\",\"many meetings 295\\n‘More than a meal! A feast!’ said Merry. ‘As soon as\\nGandalf reported that you were recovered, the preparations\\nbegan.’ He had hardly finished speaking when they were\\nsummoned to the hall by the ringing of many bells.\\nThe hall of Elrond’s house was filled with folk: Elves for\\nthe most part, though there were a few guests of other sorts.\\nElrond, as was his custom, sat in a great chair at the end of\\nthelongtableuponthedais;andnexttohimontheoneside\\nsat Glorfindel, on the other side sat Gandalf.\\nFrodo looked at them in wonder; for he had never before\\nseen Elrond, of whom so many tales spoke; and as they\\nsat upon his right hand and his left, Glorfindel, and even\\nGandalf, whom he thought he knew so well, were revealed\\nas lords of dignity and power.\\nGandalf was shorter in stature than the other two; but his\\nlong white hair, his sweeping silver beard, and his broad\\nshoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient\\nlegend. In his aged face under great snowy brows his dark\\neyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire.\\nGlorfindel was tall and straight; his hair was of shining\\ngold, his face fair and young and fearless and full of joy; his\\neyes were bright and keen, and his voice like music; on his\\nbrow sat wisdom, and in his hand was strength.\\nThe face of Elrond was ageless, neither old nor young,\\nthough in it was written the memory of many things both\\nglad and sorrowful. His hair was dark as the shadows of\\ntwilight, and upon it was set a circlet of silver; his eyes were\\ngrey as a clear evening, and in them was a light like the light\\nof stars. Venerable he seemed as a king crowned with many\\nwinters, and yet hale as a tried warrior in the fulness of his\\nstrength. He was the Lord of Rivendell and mighty among\\nboth Elves and Men.\\nIn the middle of the table, against the woven cloths upon\\nthe wall, there was a chair under a canopy, and there sat a\\nladyfairtolookupon,andsolikewassheinformofwoman-\\nhood to Elrond that Frodo guessed that she was one of his\",\"296 the fellowship of the ring\\nclose kindred.

The braids of\\nher dark hair were touched by no frost; her white arms and\\nclear face were flawless and smooth, and the light of stars\\nwas in her bright eyes, grey as a cloudless night; yet queenly\\nshe looked, and thought and knowledge were in her glance,\\nas of one who has known many things that the years bring.\\nAbove her brow her head was covered with a cap of silver\\nlacenettedwithsmallgems,glitteringwhite;buthersoftgrey\\nraiment had no ornament save a girdle of leaves wrought in\\nsilver.\\nSo it was that Frodo saw her whom few mortals had yet\\nseen; Arwen, daughter of Elrond, in whom it was said that\\nthelikenessofLu´thienhadcomeonearthagain;andshewas\\ncalled Undo´miel, for she was the Evenstar of her people.\\nLongshehadbeeninthelandofhermother’skin,inLo´rien\\nbeyondthemountains,andwasbutlatelyreturnedtoRiven-\\ndell to her father’s house.

Nothing like it has happened since Bilbo came\\nwith us. But perhaps I should not inquire too closely, since\\nElrond and Gandalf do not seem disposed to talk of this?’\\n‘I think we will not speak of it, at least not yet,’ said Frodo\\npolitely.

It\\nwould do no good to you or to others, if you tried to meddle\\nwith it again.’’ Odd sort of remark, just like Gandalf. But he\\nsaid he was looking after you, so I let things be. I am fright-\\nfully glad to see you safe and sound.’ He paused and looked\\nat Frodo doubtfully.\\n‘Have you got it here?’ he asked in a whisper. ‘I can’t help\\nfeeling curious, you know, after all I’ve heard. I should very\\nmuch like just to peep at it again.’\\n‘Yes, I’ve got it,’ answered Frodo, feeling a strange reluc-\\ntance. ‘It looks just the same as ever it did.’\\n‘Well, I should just like to see it fora moment,’ said Bilbo.\\nWhen hehad dressed,Frodo found thatwhile heslept the\\nRinghadbeenhungabouthisneckonanewchain,lightbut\\nstrong.

Bilbo smiled and laughed happily.\\nEvery item of news from the Shire that Frodo could tell –\\naided and corrected now and again by Sam – was of the\\ngreatest interest to him, from the felling of the least tree to\\nthe pranks of the smallest child in Hobbiton.

Let’s\\ngo off into a corner and polish it up!’\\nStrider smiled. ‘Come then!’ he said. ‘Let me hear it!’\\nFrodo was left to himself for a while, for Sam had fallen\\nasleep.

Frodo\\nbegan to listen.\\nAt first the beauty of the melodies and of the interwoven\\nwords in elven-tongues, even though he understood them\\nlittle, held him in a spell, as soon as he began to attend to\\nthem. Almost it seemed that the words took shape, and\\nvisions of far lands and bright things that he had never yet\\nimagined opened out before him; and the firelit hall became\\nlike a golden mist above seas of foam that sighed upon the\\nmargins of the world.

Let us eat quickly\\nand go!’\\nThat day the weather changed again, almost as if it was\\nat the command of some power that had no longer any use\\nfor snow, since they had retreated from the pass, a power\\nthat wished now to have a clear light in which things that\\nmoved in the wild could be seen from far away. The wind\\nhad been turning through north to north-west during the\\nnight, and now it failed. The clouds vanished southwards\\nand the sky was opened, high and blue.

The only road of old to Moria from\\nthe west had lain along the course of a stream, the Sirannon,\\nthat ran out from the feet of the cliffs near where the doors\\nhad stood.

There the road,\\nwhichhadbeenveeringsouthwardsbetweenthebrinkofthe\\nchannel and a steep fall of the land to the left, turned and\\nwent due east again. Rounding the corner they saw before\\nthem a low cliff, some five fathoms high, with a broken and\\njagged top. Over it a trickling water dripped, through a wide\\ncleft that seemed to have been carved out by a fall that had\\nonce been strong and full.\\n‘Indeed things have changed!’ said Gandalf. ‘But there is\\nno mistaking the place. There is all that remains of the Stair\\nFalls.

Turning quickly they saw ripples, black-edged\\nwith shadow in the waning light: great rings were widening\\noutwards from a point far out in the lake. There was a bub-\\nbling noise, and then silence. The dusk deepened, and the\\nlast gleams of the sunset were veiled in cloud.\\nGandalf now pressed on at a great pace, and the others\\nfollowed as quickly as they could. They reached the strip of\\ndry land between the lake and the cliffs: it was narrow, often\\nhardlyadozenyardsacross,andencumberedwithfallenrock\\nand stones; but they found a way, hugging the cliff, and\\nkeeping as far from the dark water as they might.

Those were happier\\ndays, when there was still close friendship at times between\\nfolk of different race, even between Dwarves and Elves.’\\n‘It was not the fault of the Dwarves that the friendship\\nwaned,’ said Gimli.\\n‘I have not heard that it was the fault of the Elves,’ said\\nLegolas.\\n‘I have heard both,’ said Gandalf; ‘and I will not give\\njudgement now. But I beg you two, Legolas and Gimli, at\\nleast to be friends, and to help me. I need you both. The\\ndoors are shut and hidden, and the sooner we find them the\\nbetter.

Sam burst into\\ntears, and fumbled with the straps, unlading all the pony’s\\npacks and throwing them on the ground. The others sorted\\nout the goods, making a pile of all that could be left behind,\\nand dividing up the rest.\\nWhen this was done they turned to watch Gandalf. He\\nappeared to have done nothing. He was standing between\\nthe two trees gazing at the blank wall of the cliff, as if he\\nwould bore a hole into it with his eyes. Gimli was wandering\\nabout,tappingthestonehereandtherewithhisaxe.Legolas\\nwas pressed against the rock, as if listening.\\n‘Well, here we are and all ready,’ said Merry; ‘but where\\nare the Doors? I can’t see any sign of them.’\\n‘Dwarf-doors are not made to be seen when shut,’ said\\nGimli.‘Theyareinvisible,andtheirownmakerscannotfind\\nthem or open them, if their secret is forgotten.’\\n‘But this Door was not made to be a secret known only to\\nDwarves,’saidGandalf,comingsuddenlytolifeandturning\\nround.‘Unlessthingsarealtogetherchanged,eyesthatknow\\nwhat to look for may discover the signs.’\\nHe walked forward to the wall.

All\\nwereeagertogetthejourneyoverasquicklyaspossible,and\\nwere willing, tired as they were, to go on marching still for\\nseveral hours. Gandalf walked in front as before.

They sounded\\ndisquietingly like signals of some sort; but after a while the\\nknocking died away and was not heard again.\\n‘That was the sound of a hammer, or I have never heard\\none,’ said Gimli.\\n‘Yes,’ said Gandalf, ‘and I do not like it.

Already the sun was\\nwestering.\\nWhile Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of\\nbrush- and fir-wood, and drew water, Aragorn tended Sam\\nand Frodo. Sam’s wound was not deep, but it looked ugly,\",\"lothlo´rien 437\\nand Aragorn’s face was grave as he examined it. After a\\nmoment he looked up with relief.\\n‘Goodluck,Sam!’hesaid.‘Manyhavereceivedworsethan\\nthis in payment for the slaying of their first orc. The cut is\\nnot poisoned, as the wounds of orc-blades too often are. It\\nshould heal well when I have tended it.

Now it is your turn,\\nFrodo!’\\n‘I am all right,’ said Frodo, reluctant to have his garments\\ntouched. ‘All I needed was some food and a little rest.’\\n‘No!’ said Aragorn. ‘We must have a look and see what\\nthe hammer and the anvil have done to you. I still marvel\\nthat you are alive at all.’ Gently he stripped off Frodo’s\\nold jacket and worn tunic, and gave a gasp of wonder.\\nThen he laughed. The silver corslet shimmered before his\\neyes like the light upon a rippling sea. Carefully he took it\\noff and held it up, and the gems on it glittered like stars, and\\nthe sound of the shaken rings was like the tinkle of rain in a\\npool.\\n‘Look, my friends!’ he called. ‘Here’s a pretty hobbit-skin\\nto wrap an elven-princeling in! If it were known that hobbits\\nhad such hides, all the hunters of Middle-earth would be\\nriding to the Shire.’\\n‘And all the arrows of all the hunters in the world would\\nbe in vain,’ said Gimli, gazing at the mail in wonder. ‘It is a\\nmithril-coat. Mithril! I have never seen or heard tell of one\\nso fair. Is this the coat that Gandalf spoke of? Then he\\nundervalued it. But it was well given!’\\n‘IhaveoftenwonderedwhatyouandBilboweredoing,so\\nclose in his little room,’ said Merry. ‘Bless the old hobbit! I\\nlove him more than ever.

Under the mail there was a shirt of soft\\nleather,butatonepointtheringshadbeendriventhroughit\\ninto the flesh. Frodo’s left side also was scored and bruised\\nwhere he had been hurled against the wall. While the others\\nset the food ready, Aragorn bathed the hurts with water in\\nwhich athelas was steeped. The pungent fragrance filled the\\ndell, and all those who stooped over the steaming water felt\\nrefreshed and strengthened. Soon Frodo felt the pain leave\\nhim, and his breath grew easy: though he was stiff and sore\\nto the touch for many days. Aragorn bound some soft pads\\nof cloth at his side.\\n‘The mail is marvellously light,’ he said. ‘Put it on again,\\nif you can bear it. My heart is glad to know that you have\\nsuch a coat. Do not lay it aside, even in sleep, unless fortune\\nbringsyouwhereyouaresafeforawhile;andthatwillseldom\\nchance while your quest lasts.’\\nWhen they had eaten, the Company got ready to go on.\\nThey put out the fire and hid all traces of it.

We have come to\\nthe eaves of the Golden Wood.

Nevertheless its folk are seldom seen, and maybe they\\ndwell now deep in the woods and far from the northern\\nborder.’\\n‘Indeed deep in the wood they dwell,’ said Aragorn, and\\nsighed as if some memory stirred in him. ‘We must fend for\\nourselves tonight. We will go forward a short way, until the\\ntrees are all about us, and then we will turn aside from the\\npath and seek a place to rest in.’\\nHe stepped forward; but Boromir stood irresolute and did\\nnot follow. ‘Is there no other way?’ he said.\\n‘What other fairer way would you desire?’ said Aragorn.\\n‘A plain road, though it led through a hedge of swords,’\\nsaid Boromir. ‘By strange paths has this Company been led,\\nand so far to evil fortune.

The branches of the\\nmallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk, and\\nthen swept upward; but near the top the main stem divided\\ninto a crown of many boughs, and among these they found\\nthat there had been built a wooden platform, or flet as such\\nthings were called in those days: the Elves called it a talan.

One will keep a\\ntraveller on his feet for a day of long labour, even if he be\\none of the tall Men of Minas Tirith.’\\nThe Elves next unwrapped and gave to each of the Com-\\npany the clothes they had brought. For each they had pro-\\nvided a hood and cloak, made according to his size, of the\\nlight but warm silken stuff that the Galadhrim wove. It was\\nhard to say of what colour they were: grey with the hue of\\ntwilight under the trees they seemed to be; and yet if they\\nwere moved, or set in another light, they were green as\\nshadowed leaves, or brown as fallow fields by night, dusk-\\nsilveraswaterunderthestars.Eachcloakwasfastenedabout\\nthe neck with a brooch like a green leaf veined with silver.\\n‘Are these magic cloaks?’ asked Pippin, looking at them\\nwith wonder.\\n‘I do not know what you mean by that,’ answered the\\nleader of the Elves. ‘They are fair garments, and the web is\\ngood, for it was made in this land.

They will not sink, lade them as you will; but they are\\nwayward if mishandled. It would be wise if you accustomed\\nyourselves to stepping in and out, here where there is a\\nlanding-place, before you set off downstream.’\\nThe Company was arranged in this way: Aragorn, Frodo,\\nand Sam were in one boat; Boromir, Merry, and Pippin in\\nanother; and in the third were Legolas and Gimli, who had\\nnow become fast friends. In this last boat most of the goods\\nand packs were stowed. The boats were moved and steered\\nwith short-handled paddles that had broad leaf-shaped\\nblades. When all was ready Aragorn led them on a trial up\",\"farewell to lo´rien 485\\nthe Silverlode. The current was swift and they went forward\\nslowly.

He found that he was lying, well\\nwrapped, under tall grey-skinned trees in a quiet corner of\\nthe woodlands on the westbank of the Great River, Anduin.\\nHe had slept the night away, and the grey of morning was\\ndim among the bare branches. Gimli was busy with a small\\nfire near at hand.\\nThey started again before the day was broad. Not that\\nmost of the Company were eager to hurry southwards: they\\nwerecontentthatthedecision,whichtheymustmakeatlatest\\nwhen they came to Rauros and the Tindrock Isle, still lay\\nsome days ahead; and they let the River bear them on at its\\nown pace, having no desire to hasten towards the perils that\\nlay beyond, whichever course they took in the end.

The dull grey hours passed without event. As the\\nthird day of their voyage wore on the lands changed slowly:\\nthe trees thinned and then failed altogether. On the eastern\\nbank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching up\\nand away towards the sky; brown and withered they looked,\\nas if fire had passed over them, leaving no living blade of\\ngreen: an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a\\nbold stone to relieve the emptiness. They had come to the\\nBrown Lands that lay, vast and desolate, between Southern\\nMirkwood and the hills of the Emyn Muil.

And that was peculiar, as you might say, seeing as we\\nwere all floating on the stream together. Just then I saw the\\neyes: two pale sort of points, shiny-like, on a hump at the\\nnear end of the log.

They\\nwerenotmorethanayardortwoaway,andFrodoheardthe\\nsoft hiss of intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting from\\nits sheath, and faced the eyes. Immediately their light was\\nshut off. There was another hiss and a splash, and the dark\\nlog-shape shot away downstream into the night. Aragorn\\nstirred in his sleep, turned over, and sat up.\\n‘What is it?’ he whispered, springing up and coming to\\nFrodo. ‘I felt something in my sleep.

If\\nhe was still following, he was very wary and cunning. At\\nAragorn’s bidding they paddled now for long spells, and the\\nbanks went swiftly by. But they saw little of the country, for\\nthey journeyed mostly by night and twilight, resting by day,\\nand lying as hidden as the land allowed. In this way the time\\npassed without event until the seventh day.\\nTheweatherwasstillgreyandovercast,withwindfromthe\\nEast, but as evening drew into night the sky away westward\\ncleared, and pools of faint light, yellow and pale green,\\nopened underthe greyshores of cloud.There thewhite rind\\nof the new Moon could be seen glimmering in the remote\\nlakes. Sam looked at it and puckered his brows.\\nThe next day the country on either side began to change\\nrapidly. The banks began to rise and grow stony. Soon they\\nwere passing through a hilly rocky land, and on both shores\\nthere were steep slopes buried in deep brakes of thorn and\\nsloe,tangledwithbramblesandcreepers.Behindthemstood\\nlow crumbling cliffs, and chimneys of grey weathered stone\\ndark with ivy; and beyond these again there rose high ridges\\ncrowned with wind-writhen firs. They were drawing near to\\nthe grey hill-country of the Emyn Muil, the southern march\\nof Wilderland.\\nThere were many birds about the cliffs and the rock-\\nchimneys,andalldayhighintheairflocksofbirdshadbeen\\ncircling, black against the pale sky.

We cannot dare\\nthe Rapids by night! But no boat can live in Sarn Gebir, be\\nit night or day.’\\n‘Back, back!’ cried Aragorn. ‘Turn! Turn if you can!’ He\\ndrove his paddle into the water, trying to hold the boat and\\nbring it round.\\n‘I am out of my reckoning,’ he said to Frodo. ‘I did not\\nknow that we had come so far: Anduin flows faster than I\\nthought. Sarn Gebir must be close at hand already.’\\nWith great efforts they checked the boats and slowly\\nbrought them about; but at first they could make only small\\nheadway against the current, and all the time they were\\ncarriednearerandnearerto theeasternbank.Nowdarkand\\nominous it loomed up in the night.\\n‘All together, paddle!’ shouted Boromir. ‘Paddle!

One\\nsmote Frodo between the shoulders and he lurched forward\\nwith a cry, letting go his paddle: but the arrow fell back,\\nfoiled by his hidden coat of mail. Another passed through\\nAragorn’s hood; and a third stood fast in the gunwale of the\\nsecond boat, close by Merry’s hand. Sam thought he could\\nglimpse black figures running to and fro upon the long\\nshingle-banks thatlay underthe eastern shore.They seemed\\nvery near.\\n‘Yrch!’ said Legolas, falling into his own tongue.\\n‘Orcs!’ cried Gimli.\\n‘Gollum’s doing, I’ll be bound,’ said Sam to Frodo. ‘And\\naniceplacetochoose,too.TheRiverseemssetontakingus\\nright into their arms!’\\nTheyallleanedforwardstrainingatthepaddles:evenSam\\ntook a hand.

At last, as far as they could\\njudge, they had reached the middle of the stream again and\\nhad driven their boats back some distance above the jutting\\nrocks. Then half turning they thrust them with all their\\nstrength towards the western shore. Under the shadow of\\nbushes leaning out over the water they halted and drew\\nbreath.\\nLegolas laid down his paddle and took up the bow that he\\nhad brought from Lo´rien. Then he sprang ashore and\\nclimbed a few paces up the bank. Stringing the bow and\\nfitting an arrow he turned, peering back over the River into\\nthe darkness. Across the water there were shrill cries, but\\nnothing could be seen.\\nFrodo looked up at the Elf standing tall above him, as he\\ngazed into the night, seeking a mark to shoot at. His head\\nwasdark,crownedwithsharpwhitestarsthatglitteredinthe\\nblack pools of the sky behind. But now rising and sailing up\\nfrom the South the great clouds advanced, sending out dark\\noutriders into the starry fields. A sudden dread fell on the\\nCompany.\\n‘Elbereth Gilthoniel!’ sighed Legolas as he looked up. Even\\nas he did so, a dark shape, like a cloud and yet not a cloud,\\nfor it moved far more swiftly, came out of the blackness in\\nthe South, and sped towards the Company, blotting out all\\nlight as it approached.

There was a harsh croaking\\nscream,asitfelloutoftheair,vanishingdownintothegloom\\nof the eastern shore. The sky was clean again. There was a\\ntumult of many voices far away, cursing and wailing in the\\ndarkness, and then silence. Neither shaft nor cry came again\\nfrom the east that night.\\nAfter a while Aragorn led the boats back upstream. They\\nfelt their way along the water’s edge for some distance, until\\nthey found a small shallow bay. A few low trees grew there\\nclose to the water, and behind them rose a steep rocky bank.\\nHere the Company decided to stay and await the dawn: it\\nwas useless to attempt to move further by night.

They sat beside the water listening to\\ntheconfused rushand roarof theRapidshidden inthe mist;\\nthey were tired and sleepy, and their hearts were as gloomy\\nas the dying day.\\n‘Well, here we are, and here we must pass another night,’\\nsaid Boromir. ‘We need sleep, and even if Aragorn had a\\nmind to pass the Gates of Argonath by night, we are all too\\ntired – except, no doubt, our sturdy dwarf.’\",\"the great river 511\\nGimli made no reply: he was nodding as he sat.\\n‘Let us rest as much as we can now,’ said Aragorn.\\n‘Tomorrow we must journey by day again.

Slowly the sky above\\ngrew lighter, and then suddenly the clouds broke, and their\\ndraggled fringes trailed away northward up the River. The\\nfogs and mists were gone.

The\\nsummit of Tol Brandir was tipped with gold. Frodo looked\\nout eastward and gazed at the tall island. Its sides sprang\\nsheer out of the running water.

Hours, I should think.’ He hesitated. ‘What\\ncan I do?’ he muttered. ‘I must go now or I shall never go. I\\nshan’t get a chance again. I hate leaving them, and like this\\nwithout any explanation. But surely they will understand.\\nSam will. And what else can I do?’\\nSlowly he drew out the Ring and put it on once more. He\\nvanished and passed down the hill, less than a rustle of the\\nwind.\\nTheothersremainedlongbytheriver-side.Forsometime\\nthey had been silent, moving restlessly about; but now they\\nweresittinginacircle,andtheyweretalking.Everynowand\\nagain they made efforts to speak of other things, of their\\nlong road and many adventures; they questioned Aragorn\\nconcerning the realm of Gondor and its ancient history, and\\nthe remnantsof itsgreat works thatcould stillbe seen inthis\\nstrange border-land of the Emyn Muil: the stone kings and\\nthe seats of Lhaw and Hen, and the great Stair beside the\\nfalls of Rauros. But always their thoughts and words strayed\\nback to Frodo and the Ring. What would Frodo choose to\\ndo? Why was he hesitating?\\n‘Heisdebatingwhichcourseisthemostdesperate,Ithink,’\\nsaidAragorn.‘Andwellhemay.Itisnowmorehopelessthan\\neverfortheCompanytogoeast,sincewehavebeentracked\",\"the breaking of the fellowship 525\\nby Gollum, and must fear that the secret of our journey is\\nalready betrayed. But Minas Tirith is no nearer to the Fire\\nand the destruction of the Burden.\\n‘Wemayremainthereforawhileandmakeabravestand;\\nbut the Lord Denethor and all his men cannot hope to do\\nwhat even Elrond said was beyond his power: either to keep\\ntheBurden secret,orto holdoffthe fullmightof theEnemy\\nwhenhecomestotakeit.Whichwaywouldanyofuschoose\\nin Frodo’s place? I do not know. Now indeed we miss\\nGandalf most.’\\n‘Grievous is our loss,’ said Legolas. ‘Yet we must needs\\nmake up our minds without his aid. Why cannot we decide,\\nand so help Frodo? Let us call him back and then vote! I\\nshould vote for Minas Tirith.’\\n‘And so should I,’ said Gimli. ‘We, of course, were only\\nsent to help the Bearer along the road, to go no further than\\nwewished;andnoneofusisunderanyoathorcommandto\\nseek Mount Doom. Hard was my parting from Lothlo´rien.\\nYet I have come so far, and I say this: now we have reached\\nthe last choice, it is clear to me that I cannot leave Frodo. I\\nwould choose Minas Tirith, but if he does not, then I follow\\nhim.’\\n‘And I too will go with him,’ said Legolas. ‘It would be\\nfaithless now to say farewell.’\\n‘It would indeed be a betrayal, if we all left him,’ said\\nAragorn. ‘But if he goes east, then all need not go with him;\\nnor do I think that all should. That venture is desperate: as\\nmuch so for eight as for three or two, or one alone. If you\\nwould let me choose, then I should appoint three com-\\npanions: Sam, who could not bear it otherwise; and Gimli;\\nand myself. Boromir will return to his own city, where his\\nfather and his people need him; and with him the others\\nshould go, or at least Meriadoc and Peregrin, if Legolas is\\nnot willing to leave us.’\\n‘Thatwon’tdoatall!’criedMerry.‘Wecan’tleaveFrodo!\\nPippin and I always intended to go wherever he went, and\\nwe still do. But we did not realize what that would mean. It\",\"526 the fellowship of the ring\\nseemed different so far away, in the Shire or in Rivendell. It\\nwould be mad and cruel to let Frodo go to Mordor. Why\\ncan’t we stop him?’\\n‘We must stop him,’ said Pippin. ‘And that is what he is\\nworrying about, I am sure. He knows we shan’t agree to his\\ngoingeast.Andhedoesn’tliketoaskanyonetogowithhim,\\npoor old fellow. Imagine it: going off to Mordor alone!’\\nPippin shuddered. ‘But the dear silly old hobbit, he ought to\\nknow that he hasn’t got to ask. He ought to know that if we\\ncan’t stop him, we shan’t leave him.’\\n‘Beggingyourpardon,’saidSam.‘Idon’tthinkyouunder-\\nstand my master at all. He isn’t hesitating about which way\\nto go. Of course not! What’s the good of Minas Tirith\\nanyway? To him, I mean, begging your pardon, Master\\nBoromir,’ he added, and turned. It was then that they dis-\\ncovered that Boromir, who at first had been sitting silent on\\nthe outside of the circle, was no longer there.\\n‘Nowwhere’shegotto?’criedSam,lookingworried.‘He’s\\nbeen a bit queer lately, to my mind. But anyway he’s not in\\nthisbusiness.He’sofftohishome,ashealwayssaid;andno\\nblame to him. But Mr. Frodo, he knows he’s got to find the\\nCracksofDoom,ifhecan.Buthe’safraid.Nowit’scometo\\nthe point, he’s just plain terrified. That’s what his trouble is.\\nOf course he’s had a bit of schooling, so to speak – we all\\nhave–sincewelefthome,orhe’dbesoterrifiedhe’djustfling\\ntheRingintheRiverandbolt.Buthe’sstilltoofrightenedto\\nstart.Andheisn’tworryingaboutuseither:whetherwe’llgo\\nalong withhim orno.

For he’ll screw himself up all\\nright, as sure as his name’s Baggins.’\\n‘Ibelieveyouspeakmorewiselythananyofus,Sam,’said\\nAragorn. ‘And what shall we do, if you prove right?’\\n‘Stop him! Don’t let him go!’ cried Pippin.\\n‘I wonder?’ said Aragorn. ‘He is the Bearer, and the fate\\nof the Burden is on him. I do not think that it is our part to\",\"the breaking of the fellowship 527\\ndrivehimonewayortheother.NordoIthinkthatweshould\\nsucceed, if we tried. There are other powers at work far\\nstronger.’\\n‘Well, I wish Frodo would ‘‘screw himself up’’ and come\\nback, and let us get it over,’ said Pippin. ‘This waiting is\\nhorrible! Surely the time is up?’\\n‘Yes,’saidAragorn.‘Thehourislongpassed.Themorning\\nis wearing away. We must call for him.’\\nAt that moment Boromir reappeared. He came out from\\nthetreesandwalkedtowardsthemwithoutspeaking.Hisface\\nlooked grim and sad. He paused as if counting those that\\nwere present, and then sat down aloof, with his eyes on the\\nground.\\n‘Where have you been, Boromir?’ asked Aragorn. ‘Have\\nyou seen Frodo?’\\nBoromirhesitatedforasecond.‘Yes,andno,’heanswered\\nslowly. ‘Yes: I found him some way up the hill, and I spoke\\nto him. I urged him to come to Minas Tirith and not to go\\neast. I grew angry and he left me. He vanished. I have never\\nseen such a thing happen before, though I have heard of it\\nin tales. He must have put the Ring on. I could not find him\\nagain. I thought he would return to you.’\\n‘Isthatallthatyouhavetosay?’saidAragorn,lookinghard\\nand not too kindly at Boromir.\\n‘Yes,’ he answered. ‘I will say no more yet.’\\n‘This is bad!’ cried Sam, jumping up. ‘I don’t know what\\nthis Man has been up to. Why should Mr. Frodo put the\\nthing on? He didn’t ought to have; and if he has, goodness\\nknows what may have happened!’\\n‘But he wouldn’t keep it on,’ said Merry. ‘Not when he\\nhad escaped the unwelcome visitor, like Bilbo used to.’\\n‘But where did he go? Where is he?’ cried Pippin. ‘He’s\\nbeen away ages now.’\\n‘How long is it since you saw Frodo last, Boromir?’ asked\\nAragorn.\\n‘Half an hour, maybe,’ he answered. ‘Or it might be an\",\"528 the fellowship of the ring\\nhour. I have wandered for some time since. I do not know! I\\ndo not know!’ He put his head in his hands, and sat as if\\nbowed with grief.\\n‘An hour since he vanished!’ shouted Sam. ‘We must try\\nand find him at once. Come on!’\\n‘Wait a moment!’ cried Aragorn. ‘We must divide up into\\npairs, and arrange – here, hold on! Wait!’\\nIt was no good. They took no notice of him. Sam had\\ndashed off first. Merry and Pippin had followed, and were\\nalready disappearing westward into the trees by the shore,\\nshouting: Frodo! Frodo! in their clear, high, hobbit-voices.\\nLegolasandGimliwererunning.Asuddenpanicormadness\\nseemed to have fallen on the Company.\\n‘Weshallallbescatteredandlost,’groanedAragorn.‘Boro-\\nmir!Idonotknowwhatpartyouhaveplayedinthismischief,\\nbut help now! Go after those two young hobbits, and guard\\nthem at the least, even if you cannot find Frodo. Come back\\nto this spot, if you find him, or any traces of him. I shall\\nreturn soon.’\\nAragorn sprang swiftly away and went in pursuit of Sam.\\nJust as he reached the little lawn among the rowans he over-\\ntook him, toiling uphill, panting and calling, Frodo!\\n‘Come with me, Sam!’ he said. ‘None of us should be\\nalone. There is mischief about. I feel it. I am going to the\\ntop,totheSeatofAmonHen,toseewhatmaybeseen.And\\nlook! It is as my heart guessed, Frodo went this way. Follow\\nme, and keep your eyes open!’ He sped up the path.\\nSam did his best, but he could not keep up with Strider\\ntheRanger,andsoonfellbehind.Hehadnotgonefarbefore\\nAragorn was out of sight ahead. Sam stopped and puffed.\\nSuddenly he clapped his hand to his head.\\n‘Whoa, Sam Gamgee!’ he said aloud. ‘Your legs are too\\nshort,souseyourhead!Letmeseenow!Boromirisn’tlying,\\nthat’s not his way; but he hasn’t told us everything. Some-\\nthing scared Mr. Frodo badly. He screwed himself up to the\\npoint, sudden. He made up his mind at last – to go. Where\",\"the breaking of the fellowship 529\\nto? Off East. Not without Sam? Yes, without even his Sam.\\nThat’s hard, cruel hard.’\\nSam passed his hand over his eyes, brushing away the\\ntears.‘Steady,Gamgee!’hesaid.‘Think,ifyoucan!Hecan’t\\nfly across rivers, and he can’t jump waterfalls. He’s got no\\ngear. So he’s got to get back to the boats. Back to the boats!\\nBack to the boats, Sam, like lightning!’\\nSam turned and bolted back down the path. He fell and\\ncut his knees. Up he got and ran on. He came to the edge of\\nthe lawn of Parth Galen by the shore, where the boats were\\ndrawnup outof thewater.No onewasthere. Thereseemed\\nto be cries in the woods behind, but he did not heed them.\\nHe stood gazing for a moment, stock-still, gaping. A boat\\nwas sliding down the bank all by itself. With a shout Sam\\nraced across the grass. The boat slipped into the water.\\n‘Coming,Mr.Frodo!Coming!’calledSam,andflunghim-\\nselffromthebank,clutchingatthedepartingboat.Hemissed\\nit by a yard. With a cry and a splash he fell face downward\\nintodeepswiftwater.Gurglinghewentunder,andtheRiver\\nclosed over his curly head.\\nAn exclamation of dismay came from the empty boat. A\\npaddle swirled and the boat put about. Frodo was just in\\ntime to grasp Sam by the hair as he came up, bubbling and\\nstruggling. Fear was staring in his round brown eyes.\\n‘Up you come, Sam my lad!’ said Frodo. ‘Now take my\\nhand!’\\n‘Saveme,Mr.Frodo!’gaspedSam.‘I’mdrownded.Ican’t\\nsee your hand.’\\n‘Here it is. Don’t pinch, lad! I won’t let you go. Tread\\nwater and don’t flounder, or you’ll upset the boat. There\\nnow, get hold of the side, and let me use the paddle!’\\nWith a few strokes Frodo brought the boat back to the\\nbank, and Sam was able to scramble out, wet as a water-rat.\\nFrodo took off the Ring and stepped ashore again.\\n‘Of all the confounded nuisances you are the worst, Sam!’\\nhe said.\\n‘Oh, Mr. Frodo, that’s hard!’ said Sam shivering. ‘That’s\",\"530 the fellowship of the ring\\nhard, trying to go without me and all. If I hadn’t a guessed\\nright, where would you be now?’\\n‘Safely on my way.’\\n‘Safely!’ said Sam. ‘All alone and without me to help you?\\nI couldn’t have a borne it, it’d have been the death of me.’\\n‘It would be the death of you to come with me, Sam,’ said\\nFrodo, ‘and I could not have borne that.’\\n‘Not as certain as being left behind,’ said Sam.\\n‘But I am going to Mordor.’\\n‘I know that well enough, Mr. Frodo. Of course you are.\\nAnd I’m coming with you.’\\n‘Now,Sam,’saidFrodo,‘don’thinderme!Theotherswill\\nbe coming back at any minute. If they catch me here, I shall\\nhave to argue and explain, and I shall never have the heart\\nor the chance to get off. But I must go at once. It’s the only\\nway.’\\n‘Ofcourseitis,’answeredSam.‘Butnotalone.I’mcoming\\ntoo, or neither of us isn’t going. I’ll knock holes in all the\\nboats first.’\\nFrodo actually laughed. A sudden warmth and gladness\\ntouchedhisheart.‘Leaveone!’hesaid.‘We’llneedit.Butyou\\ncan’t come like this without your gear or food or anything.’\\n‘Just hold on a moment, and I’ll get my stuff!’ cried Sam\\neagerly. ‘It’s all ready. I thought we should be off today.’ He\\nrushed to the camping place, fished out his pack from the\\npile where Frodo had laid it when he emptiedthe boat of his\\ncompanions’goods,grabbedaspareblanket,andsomeextra\\npackages of food, and ran back.\\n‘So all my plan is spoilt!’ said Frodo. ‘It is no good trying\\ntoescapeyou.ButI’mglad,Sam.Icannottellyouhowglad.\\nCome along! It is plain that we were meant to go together.\\nWe will go, and may the others find a safe road! Strider will\\nlook after them. I don’t suppose we shall see them again.’\\n‘Yet we may, Mr. Frodo. We may,’ said Sam.\\nSo Frodo and Sam set off on the last stage of the Quest\\ntogether. Frodo paddled away from the shore, and the River\",\"the breaking of the fellowship 531\\nbore them swiftly away, down the western arm, and past the\\nfrowning cliffs of Tol Brandir.
